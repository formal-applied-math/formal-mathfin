# FX forward: covered and uncovered interest parity

**Covered interest parity (CIP)**: with continuously-compounded domestic and
foreign rates `r_d`, `r_f` and spot `S` (domestic per unit of foreign), the
no-arbitrage forward rate for maturity `T` is

  `F(0, T) = S · exp((r_d - r_f) · T)`.

It is derived from `forward_price_from_no_arbitrage`: in a finite-state market
the forward contract paying `S_T - F` is priced by the same state prices as the
domestic zero-coupon bond (price `e^{-r_d T}`) and the foreign zero-coupon bond
held in domestic currency (price `S·e^{-r_f T}`: buy `e^{-r_f T}` units of
foreign currency at spot and invest them at `r_f`), and it is worth zero
exactly at `F = S·e^{-r_f T}/e^{-r_d T}` (`covered_interest_parity`). The
one-period discrete form is `F = S·(1 + r_d)/(1 + r_f)`.

**Uncovered interest parity**, in its risk-neutral form: under the domestic
risk-neutral measure of the Garman–Kohlhagen model (the lognormal hypothesis
`BSCallHyp` with drift `r_d - r_f`, as in `garman_kohlhagen_call_formula`),
the expected terminal spot is the same `S·e^{(r_d - r_f)T}`
(`uncovered_interest_parity`, from `expected_terminal_eq_forward`). This is a
statement about the pricing measure; the economists' UIP, the same equation
under the physical measure, is an empirical hypothesis and is not claimed
here. The two parities agree (`covered_eq_uncovered_interest_parity`): the
forward a static market prices to zero is the model's expected spot.

## Result

* `fxForward`: the CIP forward rate `S · exp((r_d - r_f) · T)`.
* `covered_interest_parity`: the zero-value forward is `fxForward`, derived
  from `forward_price_from_no_arbitrage`;
  `covered_interest_parity_discrete`: the one-period form
  `S·(1 + r_d)/(1 + r_f)`.
* `uncovered_interest_parity`: `E_Q[S_T] = fxForward` under the
  Garman–Kohlhagen risk-neutral hypothesis.
* `covered_eq_uncovered_interest_parity`: the CIP forward equals the
  risk-neutral expected spot.

domestic currency, at `S/(1 + r_f)`, the zero-value forward is
`S·(1 + r_d)/(1 + r_f)`. The foreign bond price `S/(1 + r_f)` is a price only for
`1 + r_f > 0`; the identity holds for every `r_f`. -/
