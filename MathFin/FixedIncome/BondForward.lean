# Bond forward price from no-arbitrage

A forward contract on a coupon bond, struck at forward price `X`, maturing at
the forward-expiry date `t_fe`, has zero time-0 value exactly when discounting
the strike `X` paid at `t_fe` back to today equals the bond's price net of the
discounted coupons it sheds before `t_fe`,

  `Df(t_fe) · X = P₀ - Σ_{t ≤ t_fe} Df(t) · CF(t)`,

equivalently (the usual cash-and-carry forward-price statement, keeping every
coupon `CF(t)` paid at `t ≤ t_fe` along the way, worth `Df(t) · CF(t)` today)

  `X = (P₀ - Σ_{t ≤ t_fe} Df(t) · CF(t)) / Df(t_fe)`.

Here `s` is the caller-supplied set of coupon dates in `(0, t_fe]`; nothing in
`Finset ι` itself enforces that range, so passing it correctly is the
caller's responsibility. The coupon-stripped spot `P₀ - Σ Df(t)·CF(t)` plays
the role of `S₀` in `forward_price_from_no_arbitrage`
(`MathFin/Foundations/NoArbitrageDerivations.lean`), and
`bondForwardPrice_from_no_arbitrage` derives the forward price from it: in a
finite-state market whose state prices price the bond as its pre-expiry coupons
plus its value at `t_fe`, the forward contract paying `B(t_fe) - X` is worth
zero exactly at `X = bondForwardPrice`.

## Result

* `bondForwardPrice`: the closed-form forward price
  `(P₀ - Σ Df(t)·CF(t)) / Df(t_fe)`.
* `bondForwardPrice_from_no_arbitrage`: the forward price derived from
  `forward_price_from_no_arbitrage`, with the coupon-stripped bond as the asset.

/-- **Bond forward price from no-arbitrage.** A finite-state market with state
prices `q` on the states `Ω` at the forward-expiry date `t_fe`: the zero-coupon
bond to `t_fe` costs `Df_fe = Σ q ω`, and the bond, worth `B ω` (ex-coupon) at
`t_fe` in state `ω`, is priced as its coupons paid up to `t_fe` plus its value
then, `P₀ = Σ Df(t)·CF(t) + Σ q ω · B ω`. Then the forward contract paying
`B - X` at `t_fe` is worth zero iff `X = bondForwardPrice`: this is
