# The T-forward measure — the zero-coupon bond as numéraire

The **T-forward measure** `Q^T` is the pricing measure obtained by taking the
zero-coupon bond `P(·, T)` maturing at `T` as the numéraire, instead of the money
market. Its defining property is that the **forward price is a `Q^T`-martingale**:
for any traded claim,

  `P(0, T) · 𝔼^{Q^T}[X] = 𝔼^Q[X / B_T]`,

with `B` the bank account and `P(0, T) = 𝔼^Q[1/B_T]` the bond price. In the constant-rate
model this gives `𝔼^{Q^T}[S_T] = S_0 / P(0, T) = F(0, T)`.

This is the natural next instance of the change-of-numéraire engine
(`Foundations/Numeraire`), after the stock numéraire and the exchange-option
`S²`-numéraire. Reading off the engine's slots for the bond numéraire against the
bank-account reference: the bond pays one unit at maturity, so `N_T = P(T, T) = 1`, with
`N_0 = P(0, T) = 𝔼^Q[1/B_T]` and `B_0 = 1`. This is the one `T`-forward measure of the
library: the Hull–White `S`-forward measure (`FixedIncome/TimingAdjustment`), the nominal
forward measure of the inflation swap (`FixedIncome/Inflation`) and the constant-rate case
below are all `forwardMeasure Q B` for their bank accounts `B`.

## Honest scope

In the **constant-rate** world the bond `P(t, T) = e^{−r(T−t)}` is deterministic,
so the density `dQ^T/dQ = (N_T·B_0)/(N_0·B_T) = e^{rT}/e^{rT} = 1` and `Q^T = Q`
coincides with the risk-neutral measure — the forward-price identity below then
reduces to the familiar `𝔼^Q[S_T] = S_0·e^{rT}`. The *construction* and the
change-of-numéraire identity are stated for a general bank account and carry over verbatim
to a stochastic short rate (where `Q^T ≠ Q`); only the concrete constant-rate instance is
degenerate.

## Main results

* `forwardMeasure` — the measure `Q^T` as a `numeraireMeasure` instance.
* `forwardMeasure_isProbabilityMeasure` — `Q^T` is a probability measure.
* `forwardMeasure_price` — the bond-numéraire change-of-measure identity
  `P(0,T)·𝔼^{Q^T}[X] = 𝔼^Q[X/B_T]`.
* `forwardMeasure_expected_spot` — `𝔼^{Q^T}[S_T] = S_0·e^{rT}` from the EMM property,
  at the constant bank account `e^{rT}`.
* `forwardMeasure_bs_expected_terminal` — the concrete Black–Scholes instance.

/-- The **T-forward measure** `Q^T` for the bank account `B` (its terminal value `B_T`): the
change-of-numéraire measure with the zero-coupon bond `P(·, T)` as numéraire, `N_T = 1`,
`N_0 = P(0, T) = 𝔼^Q[1/B_T]`, against the reference `B_T`, `B_0 = 1`. Its density is
`dQ^T/dQ = (1/B_T)/P(0,T)`. It is a probability measure only when `B > 0` and `1/B` is
integrable (`forwardMeasure_isProbabilityMeasure`); when `1/B` is not integrable, `∫ 1/B` is the
Bochner junk value `0` and this is not a price measure. -/
