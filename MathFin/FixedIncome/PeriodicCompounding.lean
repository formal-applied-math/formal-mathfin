# Periodic compounding against the continuously compounded bond

An account that accrues simple interest `y` per period and reinvests it grows like `(1 + y) ^ n`
over `n` periods. This file places that geometric growth next to the library's continuously
compounded zero-coupon bond `zcb r t T = exp (−r (T − t))` (`FixedIncome/ZCB.lean`), in three
statements:

* `one_add_pow_mul_zcb_log`: compounding at `y > −1` per period is exactly continuous compounding
  at the equivalent rate `log (1 + y)`, with time measured in periods: discounting the grown
  balance by `zcb (log (1 + y)) 0 n` returns the initial balance. This is the conversion
  `R_c = m · log (1 + R_m / m)` with `m = 1`.
* `one_add_mul_pow_le_inv_zcb`: at the *same* nominal rate `r`, `n` periods of length `t` (with
  `r t ≥ −1`) never out-accrue continuous compounding over the elapsed time `n · t`:
  `(1 + r t)^n ≤ 1 / zcb r 0 (n t)` (from `1 + x ≤ exp x`).
* `tendsto_one_add_div_pow_inv_zcb`: splitting a horizon `T` into `n` equal periods,
  `(1 + r T / n) ^ n → 1 / zcb r 0 T = exp (r T)` (Mathlib's `Real.tendsto_one_add_div_pow_exp`).

`eq_mul_pow_of_succ` is the closed form of the recurrence `I (n + 1) = I n · c` that every
per-period accrual index satisfies. The DeFi protocol modules (`DeFi/Compound`, `DeFi/Dai`,
`DeFi/Aave`) instantiate these lemmas for their accrual indices.

measured in periods, compounding at `y > −1` per period for `n` periods and then discounting by
the zero-coupon bond at the continuously compounded rate `log (1 + y)` returns exactly one:
