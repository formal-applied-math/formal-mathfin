# Strike-direction convexity at every scale

The European call satisfies *the same* convexity-in-`K` fact at every scale of
resolution:

1. **Payoff level**, `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)`. Convex because the positive
   part of an affine function is convex (`ConvexOn.sup` on `(S − ·)` and
   `0`).
2. **Price level, under any law**, `K ↦ ∫ (X − K)⁺ dμ`. Convex because
   integration against a positive measure preserves the convexity of the
   payoff (`convexOn_integral_call`, Mathlib's
   `integral_convexOn_of_integrand_ae`). Strictly convex wherever the law
   charges every interval of strikes (`strictConvexOn_integral_call`): a
   butterfly spread with distinct strikes pays a positive amount when `X`
   ends strictly between its outer strikes.
3. **Finite-state price level**, `K ↦ Σ q_i · max(S_i − K, 0)`. Convex
   because non-negative linear combinations of convex functions are convex
   (`ConvexPricingFunctional.callPrice_finiteState_convexOn_K`).
4. **Continuous BS price level**, `K ↦ bsV K r σ S τ`. Convex on `(0, ∞)`
   for `S, σ, τ > 0`, as scale 2 for the standard normal law, the
   Black–Scholes price being the discounted expected payoff
   (`integral_bsCall_payoff_eq_bsV`). Strictly convex: the jump-diffusion
   without jumps, `bsV_strike_strictConvexOn` in
   `JumpDiffusionStrikeConvexity.lean`.

The scales are one principle realised at different levels of integration:
scale 4 is scale 2 for the standard normal law, and scale 3, proved in
`ConvexPricingFunctional.lean` by summing convex functions, is scale 2 for a
finitely supported measure.

## Downstream consequences (one principle, many faces)

* **Bull spread** `V(K₁) ≥ V(K₂)` for `K₁ ≤ K₂` — `Antitone`-payoff after
  pricing-functional preservation of monotonicity.
* **Butterfly non-negativity at payoff** (`butterfly_payoff_nonneg`) —
  convex-payoff second-difference inequality.
* **Butterfly non-negativity at price** (`callPrice_finiteState_butterfly_nonneg`) —
  pricing functional preserves convexity, hence the same second-difference
  is non-negative at the price level.
* **Breeden-Litzenberger PDF positivity**
  (`lognormalTerminalPDF_nonneg_via_strike_convexity`) — the infinitesimal
  manifestation of price-level convexity, from `bsV_strike_convexOn` below via
  `deriv_deriv_nonneg_of_convexOn`. That convexity comes from the payoff through
  integration (`convexOn_integral_call`), not from the sign of the closed form, so
  this derives the sign of the density from the convexity of the payoff and the
  positivity of the standard normal law (used as `ϕ ≥ 0` inside
  `bs_call_formula`).

## Results

* `StrictConvexOn.smul`: a strictly convex function scaled by a positive
  constant is strictly convex.
* `convexOn_sub_const_id`: `K ↦ a − K` is convex.
* `convexOn_call_payoff`: `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` is convex in K (payoff level).
* `antitone_call_payoff`: `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` is antitone in K.
* `convexOn_integral_call`: `K ↦ ∫ (X − K)⁺ dμ` is convex, for any integrable
  `X` under a finite measure.
* `strictConvexOn_integral_call`: it is strictly convex on a convex set of
  strikes `s` when `μ {k₁ < X < k₂} ≠ 0` for all `k₁ < k₂` in `s`.
* `bsV_strike_convexOn`: `K ↦ bsV K r σ S τ` is convex on `(0, ∞)`
  (continuous BS price level).

/-! ## The price under any law

Integrating the convex payoff against a law keeps it convex, and a law that
charges every interval of strikes makes it strictly convex. Nothing about the
law is assumed beyond a finite mean. -/

/-- **The call price is convex in the strike, under any law.** For an integrable `X` under a finite
measure `μ`, `k ↦ ∫ (X − k)⁺ dμ` is convex: integration against a positive measure preserves the
convexity of the payoff (`convexOn_call_payoff`), which is Mathlib's
`integral_convexOn_of_integrand_ae`. -/

For an integrable `X` under a finite measure `μ` and a convex set `s` of strikes such that
`μ {k₁ < X < k₂} ≠ 0` whenever `k₁ < k₂` lie in `s`, `k ↦ ∫ (X − k)⁺ dμ` is strictly convex on
`s`: every butterfly spread `a C(k₁) + b C(k₂) − C(a k₁ + b k₂)` (`a, b > 0`, `a + b = 1`) with
distinct strikes `k₁ ≠ k₂` in `s` has a positive price. Its payoff is nonnegative (`convexOn_call_payoff`), and
positive when `k₁ < X < k₂`, where the call struck at `k₂` pays nothing. -/

/-! ## The continuous-price face

The Black–Scholes price is the discounted call payoff integrated against the
standard normal law (`integral_bsCall_payoff_eq_bsV`), so it inherits the
convexity of the payoff through `convexOn_integral_call`. The second strike
derivative `e^{-rτ} · ϕ(d_2) / (K σ √τ)` (`hasDerivAt_deriv_bsV_K`) is then
nonnegative as a consequence (`lognormalTerminalPDF_nonneg_via_strike_convexity`),
and also by its sign (`bsV_partial_KK_nonneg`). Both routes use the positivity of
the standard normal density: this one inside `bs_call_formula`. -/

/-- **BS call price is convex in the strike on `(0, ∞)`** — the continuous-
price face of the K-convexity principle.

The Black–Scholes price is the discounted expected call payoff under the standard normal law
(`integral_bsCall_payoff_eq_bsV`), so this is `convexOn_integral_call` for that law. The sign of
the second strike derivative is not used. -/

second-derivative apparatus of `PutStrikeConvexity` is not needed. -/
