# Call spreads tend to the digital, so call prices determine the law

A bull-call spread long `1/h` calls struck at `K` and short `1/h` calls struck at `K + h` pays
`((X − K)⁺ − (X − K − h)⁺)/h`. The payoff lies in `[0, 1]` (it is nonnegative because the call
payoff is antitone in the strike, `bull_call_spread_payoff_le`), and its absolute value is at most
`1` because the call payoff is `1`-Lipschitz in the strike (Mathlib's `abs_max_sub_max_le_abs`).
As `h ↓ 0` it tends to the digital payoff `1_{X > K}`. So in any model, minus the right strike
derivative of the call price is the price of the event `X > K`, and the call prices at every strike
determine the law of the underlying. This is the first-order form of Breeden and Litzenberger
(1978), for any law with a finite mean, not only the lognormal one.

* `tendsto_call_spread`: `(C(K) − C(K + h))/h → μ {X > K}` as `h ↓ 0`, where
  `C(k) = ∫ (X − k)⁺ dμ`, for a measurable, integrable `X` under a finite measure `μ` (dominated
  convergence).
* `measure_eq_of_integral_call_eq`: two probability laws of a log-return, each with `∫ eʸ < ∞`,
  that give the same undiscounted call price `∫ (Seʸ − K)⁺` at every strike `K > 0` (for one
  `S > 0`) are equal. The digital at the strike `Seᵃ` is the tail `P(Y > a)`.
* `hasDerivAt_integral_call`: where `X` has no atom at `K`, the call price is differentiable at
  `K` and `C'(K) = −μ {X > K}` (Mathlib's `hasDerivAt_integral_of_dominated_loc_of_lip`).
* `tendsto_call_spread_left`: the spread just below the strike, `(C(K − h) − C(K))/h`, tends to
  `μ {X ≥ K}`. So the left strike derivative is `−μ {X ≥ K}` and the right one `−μ {X > K}`.
* `differentiableAt_integral_call_iff`: the call price is differentiable at `K` iff `X` has no atom
  at `K`. At an atom the two one-sided derivatives differ by its mass, and the call price has a
  kink.

In Black–Scholes the strike derivative is `−e^{−rτ}Φ(d₂)` (`hasDerivAt_bsV_K`), from the closed
form. The digital price `e^{−rτ}Φ(d₂)` follows from it through `hasDerivAt_integral_call`
(`jumpDiffusionDigitalPrice_zero`), the same value that `bs_cash_or_nothing_formula` computes as a
Gaussian integral. The second-order form, the lognormal density as the second strike derivative of
`bsV`, is in `BlackScholes/BreedenLitzenberger.lean`.

/-- **A digital is a limit of call spreads.** For a measurable, integrable `X` under a finite
measure `μ`, the bull-call spread `(C(K) − C(K + h))/h`, where `C(k) = ∫ (X − k)⁺ dμ`, tends to
`μ {X > K}` as `h ↓ 0`: minus the right strike derivative of the undiscounted call price is the
price of the event `X > K`. The spread payoff is at most `1` in absolute value (the call payoff is
`1`-Lipschitz in the strike) and tends to `1_{X > K}` pointwise, so dominated convergence
applies. -/
