/-! # Lifting a square root of −1 through a nilpotent

Part of the SVI polynomial-sign certificate (#174).

In a commutative ring in which `2` is invertible, if `x² + 1` is nilpotent then `−1` has an exact
square root (`exists_sq_neg_one_of_nilpotent`).

squares the error, so the construction terminates after finitely many steps.
