# The life annuity-due is a contract value

A net premium is the value of a survival-contingent contract. The life annuity-due
(`lifeAnnuityDue`), which `Insurance/Insurance.lean` writes directly as the sum
`∑_{k<n} B(0, k) S(k)` of flat-rate bond prices and survival probabilities, is the value
(`Contract.value`) of the schedule of payments that pays one at each date `k < n` while the
default indicator `1{τ ≤ k}` of the lifetime `τ` is still zero (`Contracts.payFlows`,
`Contracts.defaultIndicator`), discounted on the flat-rate curve `zcb r 0`. The lifetime enters
through its survival probabilities at the dates, which are those of the force of mortality `μ`.

This is the identification of the actuarial annuity with the credit contracts of
`Models/Credit/DefaultTime.lean`: a lifetime is a default time and the annuity is a premium leg
of a credit default swap without the accrual factors (`value_cdsPremiumLeg`).

The deflator is deterministic, the flat-rate discount of the dates, and the contract is valued
under the measure `Q` of the lifetime: the statement is about the lifetime's law, with no market.

## Main results

* `lifeAnnuityDue_eq_value`: the life annuity-due is the value, on the flat-rate discount, of the
  payments of one while the default indicator is zero.

/-- **The life annuity-due is a contract value.** If the lifetime `τ` has the survival
probabilities of the force of mortality `μ` at the dates `k < n`, the annuity-due is the value, on
the flat-rate discount `zcb r 0`, of the contract paying one at each date `k < n` while the
default indicator `1{τ ≤ k}` is still zero. The value is under the law of `τ`; the survival
probabilities at the other dates are not used. -/
