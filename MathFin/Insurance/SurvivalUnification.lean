# Actuarial survival ≡ reduced-form credit survival

The actuarial survival function built from a force of mortality `μ` (`survivalFromForce`,
`Insurance/Mortality.lean`) and the reduced-form credit survival curve built from a hazard rate `h`
(`hazardSurvival`, `Models/Credit/HazardCurve.lean`) are both *defined* as
`survivalFromIntensity = exp(−∫₀ᵗ ·)` (`Probability/Analysis/ExponentialDiscount.lean`), so
`survivalFromForce_eq_hazardSurvival` is `rfl`: it records that the two names denote one function,
not a theorem about either.

The probabilistic content is the link to a random lifetime. The survival model of
`Insurance/SurvivalModel.lean` starts from an age-at-death random variable `X` and its survival
function `S_X(t) = P(X > t)`. Take for `X` a random time `τ` whose law has the hazard `h`, in the
form the credit layer uses: `P(τ ≤ a) = 1 − exp(−∫₀ᵃ h)` for `a ≥ 0` (the hypothesis of
`DefaultDensity.map_eq_withDensity`), with `h` continuous and nonnegative. Then

* `survivalFunction_eq_hazardSurvival`: `S_τ(t) = hazardSurvival h t` for `t ≥ 0`;
* `survive_eq_exp_neg_integral`: `ₜpₓ = P(τ > x + t ∣ τ > x) = exp(−∫ₓ^{x+t} h)` for `x, t ≥ 0`;
* `hasDerivAt_survivalFunction`: `S_τ' = −h · S_τ` on `t > 0`, so `h` is the force of mortality
  `−S_τ'/S_τ` of the lifetime;
* `survive_coxDefaultTime`: the hypotheses hold for the Cox default time of `Models/Credit/Cox.lean`
  (a unit-exponential clock inverted through `∫₀ᵗ h`, for `h` continuous and positive with
  `∫₀ᵗ h → ∞`), so they are satisfiable.

The single exponential holds for a deterministic intensity only. With a stochastic intensity `Λ`
the survival probability is the mixture `E[exp(−Λ_t)]` (`Cox.cox_mixing_survival`), which is not
`exp(−E[Λ_t])` in general; that case is not covered here.

## Main results

* `survivalFromForce_eq_hazardSurvival`: `survivalFromForce μ t = hazardSurvival μ t`, by `rfl`;
  the two names denote one function.
* `gompertz_cumHazard`: for `c ≠ 0`, the cumulative hazard of `u ↦ B * exp (c * u)` is
  `(B/c) * (exp (c * t) - 1)`.
* `survivalFunction_eq_hazardSurvival`: if a measurable lifetime `τ` has
  `P(τ ≤ a) = 1 - hazardSurvival h a` for `a ≥ 0` with `h ≥ 0`, its actuarial survival function
  equals `hazardSurvival h` for `t ≥ 0`.
* `survive_eq_exp_neg_integral`: under those hypotheses and `h` continuous, `ₜpₓ` of `τ` is
  `exp (-∫ s in x..x + t, h s)` for `x, t ≥ 0`.
* `hasDerivAt_survivalFunction`: under the same hypotheses, the survival function has derivative
  `-(h t * survivalFunction P τ t)` at `t > 0`.
* `survive_coxDefaultTime`: for `h` continuous and positive with cumulative hazard tending to
  `∞`, and `ξ` unit exponential, the Cox default time has `ₜpₓ = exp (-∫ s in x..x + t, h s)`.

/-- **The two survival curves are one definition.** The actuarial `survivalFromForce` and the
credit `hazardSurvival` both unfold to `survivalFromIntensity`, so this is `rfl`: it identifies two
names, and it says nothing about a random lifetime (see `survivalFunction_eq_hazardSurvival`). -/
