# The Esscher premium is a price

The **Esscher premium principle** charges for a loss `X` the mean of `X` under the Esscher
transform of the reference measure `P` with parameter `h`, the measure `P.tilted (h * X)` with
density `e^{hX}/𝔼[e^{hX}]` (`esscherPremium`): `𝔼[X e^{hX}] / 𝔼[e^{hX}]`.

**It is a price.** In any market with the unit numéraire, the claim that pays the asset at `T` is
worth the Esscher premium of the asset under the Esscher tilt of the reference measure
(`esscherPremium_eq_price`): the market's price is the contract value, and the discount is `1`.

**The insured market** (`insuredMarket`) is the one-date market (`Market.oneDate`) in which the
loss `X` is quoted at its Esscher premium until `T` and is `X` at `T`, with the unit numéraire.
The Esscher tilt is a pricing measure of it when `e^{hX}` and `X e^{hX}` are integrable
(`isPricingMeasure_insuredMarket_tilted`): it is equivalent to `P`, and the premium is the tilt's
mean of the loss. So the Esscher premium is the price of the loss under a pricing measure of an
insured market, where the market is built to quote the loss at that premium
(`price_insuredMarket_tilted`). The model has no dynamics before `T`.

## Main definitions

* `esscherPremium`: the Esscher premium `𝔼[X e^{hX}] / 𝔼[e^{hX}]`.
* `insuredMarket`: the one-date market quoting the loss at its Esscher premium.

## Main results

* `integral_tilted_eq_esscherPremium`: the Esscher premium is the mean of `X` under the tilt.
* `esscherPremium_eq_price`: in a market with unit numéraire, the claim paying the asset at `T`
  is worth the Esscher premium of the asset under the Esscher tilt of the reference measure.
* `isPricingMeasure_insuredMarket_tilted`: the Esscher tilt is a pricing measure of the insured
  market.
* `price_insuredMarket_tilted`: under it the claim paying the loss is worth the Esscher premium.
