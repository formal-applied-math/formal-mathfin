# Continuous-time first fundamental theorem of asset pricing (martingale property)

Under the risk-neutral measure, the **discounted Black–Scholes price process is a
martingale** w.r.t. the Brownian filtration — the defining property of the equivalent
martingale measure (EMM), and the operational content of the first fundamental theorem
of asset pricing in continuous time. This is the continuous-time analogue of the
discrete binomial EMM (`Binomial/SecondFTAP.lean`, `Binomial/BinomialFromFTAP.lean`).

The risk-neutral geometric Brownian motion is `S_t = S_0 exp((r − σ²/2)t + σ X_t)`,
driven by a filtered pre-Brownian motion `X`. Its discounted value is

  `e^{−rt} S_t = S_0 · exp(σ X_t − σ² t / 2)`,

i.e. `S_0` times the **Wald exponential** `exp(σ X_t − σ² t / 2)`, which is a martingale
(`ProbabilityTheory.IsFilteredPreBrownian.waldExponential_isMartingale`). Hence the
discounted price is a martingale — directly, with no further stochastic-calculus
machinery.

/-- **Continuous-time first FTAP — martingale property of the discounted price.**
For the risk-neutral geometric Brownian motion `S_t = S_0 exp((r − σ²/2)t + σ X_t)`
driven by a filtered pre-Brownian motion `X`, the discounted price process
`t ↦ e^{−rt} S_t` is a martingale w.r.t. the Brownian filtration `𝓕` under `P` — the
defining property of the equivalent martingale measure (the discounted price is a
"fair game" under the risk-neutral measure).

Immediate from the Wald exponential martingale, since `e^{−rt} S_t = S_0 · exp(σ X_t −
σ² t / 2)`. -/

/-- **The discounted GBM is an equivalent martingale measure — with `Q = P`.** When `P` is the
risk-neutral measure (the driver `X` is a `P`-pre-Brownian), the discounted price `e^{−rt} S_t` is
already a `P`-martingale, so `P` is trivially its own EMM for it, at every horizon `T`: an instance
of the model-agnostic `ContinuousMarket.IsEMM` frame at `F = ℝ`. (The physical-measure Girsanov EMM
`Q ≠ P` is a martingale measure only on `[0, T]`: `bs_discounted_isEMM`.) -/

that are `P`-a.s. nonnegative and strictly positive on a `P`-non-null set. -/
