/-! # The Picard fixed point, sliced into paths (SDE existence, the pathwise bridge)

`SDEExistence` produced the solution of `dX = b(X)dt + σ(X)dB` as the **abstract** fixed point
`picardSolution ∈ E = Lp ℝ 2 (trimMeasure_T T)` of the Picard map
`Φ(X) = η + driftProcessAssembled(b∘X) + itoProcessAssembled(σ∘X)`, under the short-horizon
contraction condition `T·L_b + √T·L_σ < 1`. That fixed point is an `L²` equivalence class on the
space–time product.

This file slices the fixed-point equation `X = Φ(X)`, which holds in `E`, into a decomposition of
representatives: `X(t, ω) = η(t, ω) + (drift limit)_t(ω) + (Itô modification)_t(ω)` for almost
every `(t, ω)` with respect to `trimMeasure_T T` (`sde_pathwise_decomposition`). The two analytic
terms are given by processes defined at every `(t, ω)`:
* the **drift** `driftProcessAssembled(b∘X)` has `coeFn` a.e. equal to the pointwise `limUnder`
  process `driftContinuousMod(b∘X)` (`driftProcessAssembled_coeFn`, `DriftProcessModification`);
* the **Itô term** `itoProcessAssembled(σ∘X)` is by construction the class of the continuous
  modification `itoContinuousMod(σ∘X)` (`ItoProcessPredictable`).

For each `t ≤ T`, the drift term is almost surely the time integral
`∫_{(0,t]} (b∘X)(s, ω) ds` of a representative of the class `b∘X = lipComp b X`
(`sde_pathwise_drift_eq_setIntegral`). A representative of a class is determined only up to a
null set of `(s, ω)`, and the per-path identity with `∫₀ᵗ b(X_s(ω)) ds` for a chosen
representative of `X` is not proved here. Nor is it proved that `X` has a representative that is
a continuous adapted process satisfying the integral equation at every `t` almost surely, which
is the textbook notion of a strong solution.

/-- **The Picard fixed point, sliced into paths.** The abstract `E`-fixed point `picardSolution`
decomposes, almost everywhere for `trimMeasure_T T` on the space–time product, into its initial
condition, a drift process and an Itô process:
`X(t, ω) = η(t, ω) + driftContinuousMod(b∘X)_t(ω) + itoContinuousMod(σ∘X)_t(ω)`.
The drift process is the pointwise `limUnder` of elementary drift integrals
(`driftProcessAssembled_coeFn`); the Itô process is the continuous modification of `(σ∘X) ● B`
(`itoProcessAssembled` is defined from `itoContinuousMod`). The fixed-point equation `X = Φ(X)`
holds in `E`; taking `coeFn` through `Lp.coeFn_add` and the two realization identities slices it
into this form. -/
