# Sklar's theorem

**Sklar's theorem** (McNeil–Frey–Embrechts, *Quantitative Risk Management*, 2015, Theorem 7.3) says
that a joint distribution function is its copula evaluated at its marginal distribution functions,
`F(x) = C(F₁(x₁), …, F_d(x_d))`, and that the copula is unique when the margins are continuous.
The converse builds a joint law from any copula and any margins.

Both directions are the one-dimensional transforms of `Foundations/Quantile.lean`, applied
coordinate by coordinate.

* **Existence (continuous margins).** The *copula of a random vector* `X` is the joint law of its
  probability-integral transforms `Uᵢ = Fᵢ(Xᵢ)` (`copulaOf`). Each `Uᵢ` is uniform
  (`hasLaw_cdf`), so this law is a copula (`isCopula_copulaOf`). The events `{Xᵢ ≤ xᵢ}` and
  `{Fᵢ(Xᵢ) ≤ Fᵢ(xᵢ)}` are nested and have the same probability `Fᵢ(xᵢ)`, so they agree almost
  surely. That gives the Sklar identity `P(X ≤ x) = C(F(x))` (`measureReal_le_eq_copulaOf`).
* **Converse (arbitrary margins).** Under any copula `C`, the vector of quantiles
  `(quantile μᵢ (vᵢ))ᵢ` has margins `μᵢ` (the quantile transform) and joint distribution function
  `x ↦ C(F₁(x₁), …, F_d(x_d))` (`measureReal_quantile_le_eq`). This needs no continuity, only the
  Galois connection `quantile μᵢ p ≤ x ↔ p ≤ Fᵢ(x)`.
* **Uniqueness (continuous margins).** A copula satisfying the Sklar identity is `copulaOf X`
  (`eq_copulaOf_of_measureReal_le`). By the converse its quantile vector has the joint distribution
  function of `X`, hence the law of `X` (`ext_of_measure_Iic_pi`). Pushing forward along the
  margins returns the copula, because `Fᵢ ∘ quantile μᵢ` is the identity on `(0, 1)` when `Fᵢ` is
  continuous.
* **Invariance.** Strictly increasing transformations of the coordinates leave the copula
  unchanged (`copulaOf_comp_strictMono`, MFE Proposition 7.7). The probability-integral transform
  of `Tᵢ(Xᵢ)` at `Tᵢ(y)` is that of `Xᵢ` at `y`.

The existence and uniqueness halves assume continuous margins. For general margins a copula still
exists, but the construction needs the randomized distributional transform, and uniqueness holds
only on the product of the ranges of the `Fᵢ`. Neither is formalized here.

## Main results

* `copulaOf`: the joint law of the probability-integral transforms of a random vector.
* `isCopula_copulaOf`, `measureReal_le_eq_copulaOf`: Sklar's theorem, existence (continuous
  margins).
* `eq_copulaOf_of_measureReal_le`: Sklar's theorem, uniqueness (continuous margins).
* `hasLaw_quantile_coord`, `measureReal_quantile_le_eq`: the converse of Sklar's theorem.
* `copulaOf_comp_strictMono`: the copula is invariant under strictly increasing transformations.
