# Second derivatives, from a formula or from convexity

A higher-order sensitivity is usually computed by differentiating an explicit formula for a
lower-order one: gamma as `∂_S Φ(d₁)`, because the call delta is `Φ(d₁)`. That computation is a
statement about the formula. It becomes a statement about the price once the formula is known
to *be* the price's derivative on a neighbourhood of the point: then `deriv` of the price agrees
with the formula near the point, and so do their derivatives there.

* `hasDerivAt_deriv_of_eventually`: `f' = g` near `x` and `g'(x) = c` give `(deriv f)'(x) = c`.
* `hasDerivAt_deriv_param_of_eventually`: the same for a mixed partial `s ↦ ∂_y F(s, y)` at
  `x`, when `∂_y F(s, y) = g s` for every `s` near `x`.
* `deriv_deriv_nonneg_of_convexOn`: the converse direction of the second-derivative test. A
  convex function's second derivative is non-negative on an open set where it is
  differentiable.

/-- If `f` has derivative `g y` at every `y` near `x`, and `g` has derivative `g'` at `x`,
then `deriv f` has derivative `g'` at `x`: the second derivative of `f` at `x` is the
derivative of its first-derivative formula. -/
