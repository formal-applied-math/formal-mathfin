/-! # Localisation in the sample space

A statement about a process with continuous paths is often proved first on the event that the
path stays in `[−N, N]` up to `T`, where the process may be replaced by a bounded one, and then
on all of `Ω`. This file collects what that needs, without stopping times.

* **Convergence in measure is local** (`tendstoInMeasure_of_ae_eqOn`, `tendstoInMeasure_of_eqOn`):
  if, on each of a sequence of events whose complements have measure tending to `0`, the sequence
  agrees with one converging in measure, and the limit agrees with the other limit, the sequence
  converges in measure. The events need not be measurable.
* **Limits in measure are local** (`ae_eq_of_tendstoInMeasure_of_eqOn`): two sequences converging
  in measure that agree on an event have limits that agree almost everywhere on it. This is
  Mathlib's `tendstoInMeasure_ae_unique` on an event.
* **Continuous paths stay bounded** (`tendsto_measure_compl_abs_le`): the events "the path stays
  in `[−N, N]` up to `T`" exhaust `Ω` in probability.
* **Continuous modifications are indistinguishable** (`ae_forall_eq_of_continuousOn`) on
  `[0, T]`: the analogue, for a closed interval, of Degenne's
  `indistinguishable_of_modification_on`, which is stated on an open set. On events that shrink
  with time the paths agree up to a random time (`ae_forall_eq_of_continuousOn_of_antitone`), and
  two processes with continuous paths that are, at each time, limits in measure of the same
  sequence are indistinguishable (`ae_forall_eq_of_tendstoInMeasure`).
* **Reading a process at a random level** (`measurableSet_forall_abs_le`,
  `measurable_apply_countable`): for continuous paths "bounded by `R` on `[0, T]`" is an event, and
  `ω ↦ f (n ω) ω` is measurable for a measurable `n` with countably many values.

/-- **Convergence in measure is local.** If on each of a sequence of events `A N`, whose
complements have measure tending to `0`, the sequence `g` agrees almost everywhere with a
sequence `G N` that converges in measure to `H N`, and `h` agrees with `H N` almost everywhere on
`A N`, then `g` converges in measure to `h`. The events need not be measurable. -/
