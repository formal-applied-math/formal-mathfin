# Continuous-time market vocabulary: `IsEMM`, simple strategies, no-arbitrage

A **model-agnostic** frame for the continuous-time first fundamental theorem of asset
pricing (FTAP), parametric over a finite-dimensional real inner-product-space-valued
discounted price process `S : ℝ≥0 → Ω → F`. The Black–Scholes model (`ContinuousFTAP.lean`)
instantiates it at `F = ℝ`; a multi-asset model would instantiate at `F = Fin n → ℝ`.

* `IsEMM 𝓕 P S T Q` (`EquivMartingaleMeasure.lean`, one notion for every time index) at time
  `ℝ≥0`: `Q ≈ P` (mutual absolute continuity) and `S` is a `Q`-martingale w.r.t. the filtration
  `𝓕` on `{t ≤ T}`, i.e. the process stopped at `T` is a `Q`-martingale. `IsEMM.sampled` takes it
  to time `ℕ` along a schedule. It is what an equivalent measure obtained by a density change on
  `𝓕_T` can be: the Girsanov/Esscher
  measure makes the discounted Black–Scholes price a martingale on `[0, T]` and no further
  (`bs_discounted_isEMM`). A martingale on all of `ℝ≥0` is an EMM at every horizon.
* `SimpleStrategy 𝓕 F` — a piecewise-constant, predictable, bounded trading strategy:
  finitely many trading dates `time : Fin (N+1) → ℝ≥0` and `𝓕`-measurable bounded holdings
  `hold : Fin N → Ω → F` between consecutive dates.
* `SimpleStrategy.gains` — the discounted terminal gains of a simple strategy against `S`.
* `NoArbitrageSimple 𝓕 P S T` — no simple strategy trading up to `T` has gains that are `P`-a.s.
  nonnegative and strictly positive on a `P`-non-null set.
* `martingale_stopped_of_setIntegral_eq` — the way an `IsEMM` is built: adaptedness, integrability
  and the set-integral martingale identity on `[0, T]` give the stopped martingale.
* `SimpleStrategy.schedule`, `SimpleStrategy.toDiscrete` — the strategy's trading dates as a
  monotone schedule `ℕ → ℝ≥0`, and its holdings as a discrete predictable strategy for the price
  sampled along it; `SimpleStrategy.gains_eq_martingaleTransform` says the gains are the
  martingale transform of the sampled price by it.
* `IsEMM.sampled` — a continuous-time EMM, sampled along a monotone schedule inside `[0, T]`, is a
  discrete-time `MathFin.IsEMM`.
* `isEMM_noArbitrageSimple` — the forward theorem: `IsEMM.sampled` along the strategy's schedule,
  then the discrete forward theorem `MathFin.IsEMM.noArbitrage` (vector-valued, `FTAP.lean`).

## Scope: meaning-1 (operational) vs. meaning-2 (Delbaen–Schachermayer) FTAP

This file builds **meaning 1**: an EMM for a *given* process, restricted to the honest,
economically transparent class of *simple* (piecewise-constant) strategies. It deliberately
does **not** build meaning 2, the Delbaen–Schachermayer theorem (`NFLVR ⟺ ∃ EMM` for a
general locally-bounded semimartingale, admissible strategies over a continuum of trading
times, and the general stochastic integral `∫ φ dS`). Absent by design:

* general **admissible** strategies (not just piecewise-constant) and the general stochastic
  integral `∫ φ dS` against a semimartingale;
* **NFLVR** (no free lunch with vanishing risk) and its distinction from plain no-arbitrage;
* the **converse** direction `NoArbitrageSimple 𝓕 P S T → ∃ Q, IsEMM 𝓕 P S T Q`, and closedness
  of the set of claims super-replicable from zero wealth (the Kreps–Yan / Hahn–Banach core DS
  needs).

`IsEMM` here is stated *on a process* `S`, exactly the object Delbaen–Schachermayer's theorem
would produce — so this frame is a strict sub-object of the DS one, and extending it to
meaning 2 is additive (new strategy class + new theorem), not a rewrite.

One such extension already exists. `Foundations/MarketCompleteness` states replication,
superreplication duality and uniqueness of the pricing measure over the **Itô-integrable
predictable** integrands rather than `SimpleStrategy`. That widening is forced by the
mathematics, not chosen: the hedge martingale representation returns is a general predictable
process, and a general `L²` claim is not the terminal value of any piecewise-constant holding,
so a completeness statement over `SimpleStrategy` would have no witnesses. `SimpleStrategy`
remains the right class *here*, where the whole point is that the forward no-arbitrage
conclusion needs no stochastic integration at all — a finite sum of predictable increments. The
two classes coexist; neither file changes the other, and `IsEMM` is shared.

## Main definitions

* `SimpleStrategy`: finitely many trading dates `time 0 ≤ ⋯ ≤ time N` with bounded holdings
  `hold i` over `(time i, time i+1]`, each strongly measurable for `𝓕 (time i)`.
* `SimpleStrategy.gains`: the terminal gains `∑ᵢ ⟪hold i, S (time (i+1)) − S (time i)⟫` of a
  simple strategy against a price process `S`.
* `NoArbitrageSimple`: no simple strategy trading up to `T` has `P`-a.s. nonnegative gains that
  are positive on a `P`-non-null set.
* `sampledFiltration`: the `ℕ`-filtration `n ↦ 𝓕 (t n)` obtained by sampling a filtration along a
  monotone schedule `t`.
* `SimpleStrategy.schedule`, `SimpleStrategy.toDiscrete`: a strategy's trading dates as a
  schedule, and the strategy read as a discrete holding process.

## Main results

* `martingale_stopped_of_setIntegral_eq`: a process adapted and `Q`-integrable on `{t ≤ T}` that
  satisfies the set-integral martingale identity there is a martingale once stopped at `T`.
* `martingale_comp_monotone`: a `Q`-martingale sampled along a monotone schedule is a discrete
  `Q`-martingale for the sampled filtration.
* `SimpleStrategy.gains_eq_martingaleTransform`: the gains of a simple strategy are the discrete
  martingale transform of the sampled price by `toDiscrete`.
* `IsEMM.sampled`: a continuous-time `IsEMM`, sampled along a monotone schedule, is a
  discrete-time `IsEMM`.
* `isEMM_noArbitrageSimple`: if `IsEMM 𝓕 P S T Q` holds, there is no simple-strategy arbitrage
  up to `T` (the forward direction only).

The proof is the discrete forward theorem. A simple strategy `ψ` is a discrete predictable
strategy (`toDiscrete`) for the price sampled at its own trading dates (`schedule`, a monotone
schedule inside `[0, T]`): the sampled price is a discrete EMM (`IsEMM.sampled`) and the gains
`ψ.gains S` are the martingale transform of the sampled price by the holdings
(`gains_eq_martingaleTransform`). So `MathFin.IsEMM.noArbitrage` (`FTAP.lean`) applies, and the
continuous theorem has no argument of its own. -/
