# Freezing an independent variable

If `X` and `Y` are independent, the expectation of `g(X, Y)` can be computed by freezing `X` at
a value `x`, averaging `g(x, Y)` over `Y` alone, and then averaging the result over the law of
`X`:

  `𝔼[g(X, Y)] = ∫ x, 𝔼[g(x, Y)] d(law X)`.

This is the *freezing lemma*. When `X = N` is a count it is the law of total expectation over the
number of jumps, the step every Poisson-mixture computation takes: the Merton jump-diffusion price
(`BlackScholes/MertonModel.lean`) and the compound-Poisson moment generating function
(`Actuarial/CompoundPoissonMGF.lean`) both go through it. With `X` a jump part of any law it is
the mixing formula of `BlackScholes/JumpDiffusionMixing.lean`: a jump-diffusion call is the
Black–Scholes price averaged over the jumps.

The proof composes two Mathlib facts: independence makes the joint law the product of the
marginal laws (`IndepFun.map_prod_eq_prod_map_map`), and an integral against a product measure
is an iterated integral (`integral_prod`).

Its conditional form is Shreve's *independence lemma* (*Stochastic Calculus for Finance II*,
Lemma 2.3.4): if `X` is measurable for a σ-algebra `𝓜` and `Y` is independent of `𝓜`, then

  `𝔼[g(X, Y) | 𝓜] = G(X)`, with `G(x) = 𝔼[g(x, Y)]`.

Given `𝓜`, `X` is known and `Y` keeps its law. On an event `s ∈ 𝓜` the joint law of `(X, Y)`
is the law of `X` on `s` times the law of `Y` (`map_restrict_prodMk_of_indep`), so the
unconditional computation runs on every such event, which characterizes the conditional
expectation. This is the step that prices an option at an intermediate date: the state at `t` is
known, and the increment to maturity is independent of the past (the American put's Brownian
transitions, `BlackScholes/AmericanPut/Stopping/BrownianTransition.lean`, and the jump-diffusion
prices of `BlackScholes/JumpDiffusionOptionPrices.lean`).

## Main results

* `integrable_comp_prodMk_iff_of_indepFun`: `g(X, Y)` is integrable exactly when `g` is
  integrable against the product of the laws.
* `integral_comp_prodMk_of_indepFun`: the freezing lemma.
* `integrable_prod_map_of_countable`: for a countable-valued `X`, integrability against the
  product of the laws is checked one value of `X` at a time.
* `integral_comp_prodMk_of_indepFun_of_countable`: the freezing lemma for a countable-valued `X`
  and a nonnegative `g`, with integrability checked one value of `X` at a time.
* `integral_comp_of_hasLaw_of_countable`: integrating out a countable variable. For `X` with
  a countable law `ν`, independent of `Y`, and a nonnegative `F` whose expectations
  `c a = 𝔼[F(a, Y)]` are finite and integrable against `ν`, `𝔼[F(X, Y)] = ∫ a, c a ∂ν`. With
  `ν = Poisson(Λ)` this is the Poisson-mixture step.
* `condExp_comp_prodMk_of_indep`: the conditional freezing lemma (Shreve's independence lemma),
  `𝔼[g(X, Y) | 𝓜] = G(X)` for `X` measurable for `𝓜` and `Y` independent of `𝓜`.
* `indepFun_prodMk_of_indepFun_prodMk`: if `X` is independent of `(Y, W)` and `Y` of `W`, then
  `Y` is independent of `(X, W)`. Mutual independence of three variables can be stated with any
  of them split off first.
