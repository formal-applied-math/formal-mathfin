# No-arbitrage core: a nonnegative zero-mean payoff vanishes

The shared analytic heart of the forward FTAP. A `Q`-integrable
`f` that is `Q`-a.s. nonnegative with `∫ f dQ = 0` is `Q`-a.s. zero, so its positive set is
`Q`-null (`ae_zero_of_nonneg_of_integral_zero`). The zero integral comes from a martingale
transform started at `0` (`martingale_nonneg_terminal_ae_zero`, below), which is what the
discrete-time `IsEMM.noArbitrage` does; the one-period, finite-Ω and continuous-time
(`ContinuousMarket.isEMM_noArbitrageSimple`, through sampling) forward directions are its
instances. `ae_eq_zero_of_nonneg_of_null_pos` turns the null positive set into
the `=ᵐ 0` form of the no-arbitrage definitions.

/-- **A nonnegative payoff with zero mean vanishes a.s.** If `f` is `Q`-integrable, `Q`-a.s.
nonnegative, and has `∫ f dQ = 0`, then `{f > 0}` is `Q`-null. The common closing step of the
forward FTAP in every setting. -/

set. -/
