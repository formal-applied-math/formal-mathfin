# A replicated claim is worth its initial wealth

The argument behind "complete ⟹ the pricing measure is unique", once. Fix a class `Gains` of
terminal gains (the terminal wealth of a self-financing strategy started from nothing) and call a
measure `Q` *gains-neutral* if every gain is `Q`-integrable with `Q`-mean zero. A gains-neutral
probability measure dominated by `P` prices a claim replicated `P`-almost surely, `H = x + G` with
`G ∈ Gains`, at its initial wealth `x` (`integral_eq_of_replicates`). If every event of a
σ-algebra `𝓖` has its indicator replicated, two gains-neutral measures then agree on `𝓖`
(`measure_eq_of_replicates`): both give the event the initial wealth of its replication.

It has two instances, which differ only in what makes the gains neutral:
* the discrete market (`IsEMM.measure_eq_of_isCompleteMarket`, `Foundations/FTAP.lean`): the gains
  `martingaleTransform φ S T` are a `Q`-martingale started at `0` under any equivalent martingale
  measure;
* the Brownian market (`measure_eq_of_pricesGainsAtZero`, `Foundations/MarketCompleteness.lean`):
  the gains are the terminal Itô integrals `∫₀ᵀ φ dB`, centered under the reference measure, and
  neutrality under other measures is the hypothesis `PricesGainsAtZero`.

## Main results

* `integral_eq_of_replicates` — a gains-neutral probability measure `Q ≪ P` prices a replicated
  claim `H =ᵐ[P] x + G` at `x`.
* `measureReal_eq_of_replicates` — the indicator case: `Q A = x`.
* `measure_eq_of_replicates` — two gains-neutral probability measures `≪ P` agree on every event
  of `𝓖` whose indicator is replicated.

/-- **A replicated claim is worth its initial wealth.** If `Q` is a probability measure dominated
by `P`, the gain `G` is `Q`-integrable with `Q`-mean zero, and `H = x + G` `P`-almost surely, then
`∫ H dQ = x`: transport the almost-sure equality along `Q ≪ P`, then integrate. -/

/-- **Replication determines the pricing measure.** Let `Gains` be a class of gains, and `Q₁`, `Q₂`
probability measures dominated by `P` under which every gain is integrable with mean zero. If the
indicator of every `𝓖`-measurable event is `P`-almost surely `x + G` for some `x` and `G ∈ Gains`
(the market is complete for `𝓖`), then `Q₁` and `Q₂` agree on `𝓖`: replicate the indicator of `A`;
both measures give `A` the initial wealth `x` (`measureReal_eq_of_replicates`). -/
