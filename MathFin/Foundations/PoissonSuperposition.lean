# Superposition of Poisson streams: merging two arrival-time constructions

Two counting processes built from independent families of i.i.d. `Exp(r₁)` and `Exp(r₂)`
interarrival times (`Foundations/PoissonCounting`) merge into a count with `Poisson((r₁ + r₂)·t)`
law at every time `t ≥ 0`. The marginal laws are derived by `map_count_eq_poissonMeasure`, and the
independence of the two counts is derived from that of the interarrival families; the
convolution is Mathlib's `IndepFun.hasLaw_add_poissonMeasure` (the sum of independent Poisson
variables is Poisson), consumed directly. This is the one-time marginal of the merged stream;
that the merged count is a Poisson process (independent increments, exponential merged
interarrival times) is not proved.

## Main results

* `PoissonSuperposition.map_add_count_eq_poissonMeasure` — the merged count has
  `Poisson((r₁ + r₂)·t)` law at every time `t ≥ 0`.

/-- **Superposition of two arrival-time constructions.** Let `ξ` and `η` be families of i.i.d.
`Exp(r₁)` and `Exp(r₂)` interarrival times, independent of each other, and `N₁`, `N₂` the
counting processes they generate (`N t = k` iff the `k`-th arrival has happened by `t` but the
`(k+1)`-st has not). Then for every `t ≥ 0` the merged count `N₁ t + N₂ t` has the
`Poisson((r₁ + r₂)·t)` law.

The marginals `Poisson(r₁ t)` and `Poisson(r₂ t)` are derived from the constructions
(`PoissonCounting.map_count_eq_poissonMeasure`); the two counts are independent because each is
a function of its own interarrival family (`measurable_count_comap`); the convolution is
`IndepFun.hasLaw_add_poissonMeasure`. Only the one-time marginal of the merged stream is stated. -/
