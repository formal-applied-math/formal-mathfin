# Second FTAP on a finite probability space: complete ⟺ unique equivalent martingale measure

For the finite-Ω, finite-horizon, single-asset market of `FTAPDiscrete.lean` (a full-support
probability `P`, an adapted discounted price `S`, a horizon `T`), a market with no arbitrage and
full information at the horizon (`𝓕 T = ⊤`) is **complete** (`IsCompleteMarket`: every claim is
the terminal wealth of a predictable strategy started from some initial wealth) **iff** its
equivalent martingale measure is **unique**.

* `complete ⇒ unique` is general (`IsEMM.measure_eq_of_isCompleteMarket`, `Foundations/FTAP.lean`):
  replicate the indicator of an event and read off its probability.
* `unique ⇒ complete` is the geometric half, by contraposition. The claims replicable from some
  wealth are `constants ⊔ gainsSubspace`. If that subspace is proper, a nonzero functional `η`
  vanishes on it, i.e. `∑ η = 0` and `η` annihilates every gain. Perturbing the strictly positive
  weights of an equivalent martingale measure `Q₀` by a small multiple of `η` keeps them strictly
  positive and still annihilating, so they build a second equivalent martingale measure
  (`exists_isEMM_of_pos_dual`), different from `Q₀` because `η ≠ 0`.

## Main results

* `isCompleteMarket_of_unique` — a unique equivalent martingale measure makes the market complete.
* `ftap_two` — under no arbitrage, and with full information `𝓕 T = ⊤` at the horizon, the market
  is complete iff the equivalent martingale measure is unique.
