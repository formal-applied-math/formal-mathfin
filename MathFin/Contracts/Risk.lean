# The risk of a contract position

A position in a contract `c`, bought at price `p`, loses `p − pathPV` along each outcome: the price
paid less the discounted payoff (`Contract.loss`). Its value-at-risk and expected shortfall are
those of `RiskMeasures/ValueAtRisk.lean`, taken under a law `P` of the outcomes. `P` is the
measure the risk is measured under, and need not be the pricing measure: the price `p` is an
input, typically a `Contract.value` under some `Q`.

* A book's expected shortfall is at most the sum of its contracts'
  (`expectedShortfall_loss_both_le`), which is the subadditivity of expected shortfall
  (`expectedShortfall_add_le`) read through `Contract.pathPV_both`. Value-at-risk has no such bound.
* A position whose payoff is never negative cannot lose more than its price
  (`valueAtRisk_loss_le_of_nonneg`), so a long call's value-at-risk is at most its premium
  (`valueAtRisk_loss_europeanCall_le`).
* In the binomial tree, a seller who receives a European contract's value and follows its hedge
  (`Binomial.pathPV_eq_value_add_gains`) carries zero value-at-risk and zero expected shortfall,
  under every law of the coin flips (`Binomial.valueAtRisk_hedged_eq_zero`).

## Main definitions

* `Contract.loss` — the loss of a position in a contract bought at a given price.

## Main results

* `expectedShortfall_loss_both_le`, `valueAtRisk_loss_le_of_nonneg`,
  `valueAtRisk_loss_europeanCall_le`, `Binomial.valueAtRisk_hedged_eq_zero`.

## Source

The layered separation of contract semantics from pricing semantics, and the
framing "the contract is not the model", are due to Paul Bilokon,
*The Contract Is Not the Model: Proof-Carrying Exotic Derivatives and the
Economics of Model Risk* (working paper, 9 August 2026; Mathematical
Finance, Imperial College London), with code at
<https://github.com/thalesians/lean_contracts> (Apache-2.0). That paper in
turn builds on the compositional contract-DSL of
Peyton Jones, Eber and Seward (2000) and the certified-contract work of Bahr,
Berthold and Elsman (2015) and Annenkov (2018).

No code is copied from `lean_contracts`; every definition and proof here is
written for this library. See `docs/specs/2026-08-16-contracts-tower-design.md`
