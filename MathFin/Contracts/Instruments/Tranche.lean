# A credit tranche leg, as a contract

The loss of the tranche `[a, d]` of a credit portfolio, as a fraction of its notional, is
`((L − a)⁺ − (L − d)⁺)/(d − a)` when the portfolio has lost the fraction `L`
(`tranchePayoff` in `Risk/Credit/TrancheLoss.lean`). Reading `L` as the single underlying `()` of
a scenario, that is a `Payoff`, and paying it at `T` is a `Contract`.

## Main definitions

* `trancheLossPayoff`: the tranche loss as a payoff on the portfolio loss observed at `T`.
* `trancheLeg`: the tranche loss paid at `T`.

## Main results

* `eval_trancheLossPayoff`: the payoff evaluates to `tranchePayoff a d` of the loss observed at `T`.
* `value_trancheLeg`: on a deterministic discount curve the leg is worth the discounted expected
  `tranchePayoff`.

## Scope

The portfolio loss fraction is the underlying `X () T`, a given process; its law (for instance the
large-pool limit of `Risk/Credit/TrancheLoss.lean`) is not part of these statements.
