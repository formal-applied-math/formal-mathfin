# Schedules of payments, as contracts

A schedule of payments is a contract: `payFlows t a n` pays the payoff `a i` at `t i` for each
`i < n`, and along a scenario it is worth `∑ D(tᵢ) · aᵢ` (`pathPV_payFlows`); `fixedFlows t c n`
is the case of constant payoffs, `c i` at `t i`, worth `∑ D(tᵢ) cᵢ` (`pathPV_fixedFlows`). These
are the legs of bonds, annuities, swaps and credit default swaps. Nothing here assumes a model or
a pricing measure: the value of a schedule in every model is `value_fixedFlows`
(`Pricing/Value.lean`), and the bonds and swaps of a deterministic curve are in
`Models/Rates/DeterministicCurve.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `payFlows` — a schedule of payments; `fixedFlows` — the schedule of fixed cash flows.

## Main results

* `pathPV_payFlows`, `pathPV_fixedFlows` — what a schedule pays along a scenario.

## Source

The layered separation of contract semantics from pricing semantics, and the
framing "the contract is not the model", are due to Paul Bilokon,
*The Contract Is Not the Model: Proof-Carrying Exotic Derivatives and the
Economics of Model Risk* (working paper, 9 August 2026; Mathematical
Finance, Imperial College London), with code at
<https://github.com/thalesians/lean_contracts> (Apache-2.0). That paper in
turn builds on the compositional contract-DSL of
Peyton Jones, Eber and Seward (2000) and the certified-contract work of Bahr,
Berthold and Elsman (2015) and Annenkov (2018).

No code is copied from `lean_contracts`; every definition and proof here is
written for this library. See `docs/specs/2026-08-16-contracts-tower-design.md`
§6 for the full credit line.
