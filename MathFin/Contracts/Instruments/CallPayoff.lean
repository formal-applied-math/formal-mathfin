# Call payoffs in the strike

The call payoff `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)`, as a function of the strike, is convex and antitone. These are
facts about the payoff, before any model: the static no-arbitrage relations of option prices
(convexity in the strike, butterflies, the implied density) are these facts carried to prices by
the pricing functional (`Pricing/ConvexPricingFunctional.lean`, and under an arbitrary law
`Models/BlackScholes/StrikeConvexity.lean`).

A capped call with strikes `K₁ ≤ K₂` pays `min(max(S − K₁, 0), K₂ − K₁)`. Below `K₁` the payoff is
`0`; between `K₁` and `K₂` it tracks `S − K₁`; above `K₂` it is capped at `K₂ − K₁`. That is the
bull-call spread `max(S − K₁, 0) − max(S − K₂, 0)`, so a capped call is a long call at `K₁` and a
short call at `K₂` (`Contracts/Instruments/Options.lean` builds it that way).

## Main results

* `convexOn_call_payoff`: `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` is convex.
* `antitone_call_payoff`: `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` is antitone.
* `cappedCall_eq_bull_spread`: the capped call is the bull-call spread.

/-- The affine function `K ↦ a − K` is convex on `Set.univ`. Affine
functions are simultaneously convex and concave; the inequality holds
with equality. -/

/-- **Call payoff is convex in the strike**: `K ↦ max(S − K, 0)` is convex.

This is the structural spine of static option-price no-arbitrage relations.
Butterfly non-negativity and Breeden-Litzenberger PDF positivity are
discrete and infinitesimal consequences (respectively) of this single fact,
after passing through risk-neutral expectation. -/

/-- **Call payoff is antitone in the strike**: higher strikes pay less.

Equivalent to monotonicity of `max(·, 0)` composed with `K ↦ S − K` (which
is itself antitone). The single-line consequence of monotonicity of `max`. -/
