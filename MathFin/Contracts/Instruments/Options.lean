# Options, as contracts

The instruments: the European call and put, the cash-or-nothing digital, the forward, the
capped call and the power call, each a `Contract Unit` written in the payoff language of `Contracts/Core.lean`; the exchange option is a
`Contract (Fin 2)` on two underlyings.
Nothing here assumes a model. What is proved is what the instruments pay, along every scenario,
and what follows for their values in every model through the linearity of `Contract.value`.
Their prices in a particular model live in that model's file (`Contracts/Models/BlackScholes.lean`).

The capped call is *defined* by composition, as a long call at `K₁` and a short call at `K₂`;
`cappedCall_payoff_eq` is what earns it the name: for `K₁ ≤ K₂` it pays
`min(max(S − K₁, 0), K₂ − K₁)` (`MathFin.cappedCall_eq_bull_spread`).

## Main definitions

* `europeanCallPayoff` — the call's payoff on its own.
* `europeanCall`, `europeanPut`, `digitalCall`, `forward` — the single-maturity instruments.
* `cappedCall` — a long `europeanCall K₁ T` combined with a short `europeanCall K₂ T`.
* `powerCall` — the call on `S_T ^ a`, the power being the payoff language's `rpow` node.
* `geomAsianCall` — the call on the geometric average of the underlying over `n` dates, from
  `Payoff.obsProd` and `rpow` at `1/n`.
* `chooser` — the chooser option as the static portfolio of a call and a put at the chooser date.
* `exchangeOption` — pays `max (S¹_T − S²_T) 0`.

## Main results

* `pathPV_europeanCall_eq_put_add_forward` — a call pays a put plus a forward on every path.
* `value_europeanCall_eq_put_add_forward` — so, in any model where the put's and the forward's
  discounted payoffs are integrable, the call is worth the put plus the forward.
* `cappedCall_payoff_eq` — for `K₁ ≤ K₂`, `cappedCall K₁ K₂ T` pays the capped payoff.

## Source

The layered separation of contract semantics from pricing semantics, and the
framing "the contract is not the model", are due to Paul Bilokon,
*The Contract Is Not the Model: Proof-Carrying Exotic Derivatives and the
Economics of Model Risk* (working paper, 9 August 2026; Mathematical
Finance, Imperial College London), with code at
<https://github.com/thalesians/lean_contracts> (Apache-2.0). That paper in
turn builds on the compositional contract-DSL of
Peyton Jones, Eber and Seward (2000) and the certified-contract work of Bahr,
Berthold and Elsman (2015) and Annenkov (2018).

Compositional contract construction — building an instrument from simpler ones
and pricing it by composition — is the core of Bilokon's DSL and of Peyton
Jones, Eber and Seward before him; what is added here is that the composition
is priced through the library's own closed forms rather than left as a
denotational identity.

No code is copied from `lean_contracts`; every definition and proof here is
written for this library. See `docs/specs/2026-08-16-contracts-tower-design.md`
§6 for the full credit line.

/-- The reified geometric-average Asian call over the `n` averaging dates `τ`: pays

/-- The reified simple chooser option, by static replication. At the chooser date `t₁ ≤ T` the
holder takes the more valuable of the call and the put, `max (C_{t₁}, P_{t₁})`; put–call parity
at `t₁` (`MathFin.chooserPayoff_decompose_BS`) writes that as `C_{t₁} + max (K e^{−r(T−t₁)} −
S_{t₁}, 0)`. The first term is what a call struck at `K` maturing at `T` is worth at `t₁`, the
second pays at `t₁`, so the chooser is the call at `K, T` together with a put maturing at `t₁`
struck at `K e^{−r(T−t₁)}`. The payoff language has no node for the conditional value at `t₁`,
so this is the replicating portfolio, not the holder's choice written as a payoff; the rate `r`
enters only through the put's strike. -/

/-- A capped call struck at `K₁` and capped at `K₂`, built as a long call at `K₁` and a

real equation to the contract's own `pathPV`. This is what earns the definition its name. -/
