# The exchange option priced in the two-asset Black–Scholes model

`Contracts/Models/BlackScholes.lean` prices the one-underlying instruments; the exchange option
`exchangeOption T` observes two underlyings, so it gets its own model map.
`BlackScholes.assets₂` is the two-asset Black–Scholes market at maturity: asset `i` is
`bsTerminal Sⁱ₀ r σᵢ T (Wᵢ ω)`, read at every time like `BlackScholes.assets`.

Nothing new is proved about Margrabe's formula. The contract's value is the discounted expected
exchange payoff (`Contract.value_pay`), which is exactly the integral `margrabe_exchange_price`
evaluates under the model measure, for jointly Gaussian standard-normal drivers.

## Main definitions

* `BlackScholes.assets₂` — the two-asset Black–Scholes terminal market as a model map
  `Fin 2 → ℝ≥0 → Ω → ℝ`.

## Main results

* `BlackScholes.value_exchangeOption` — `exchangeOption T` is worth `margrabePrice S¹₀ S²₀ σ_eff T`.
