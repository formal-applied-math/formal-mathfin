# Fixed cash flows in the Heath–Jarrow–Morton model

An `HJM.HJMModel` has a short rate `r(t) = f(t,t)` and so a stochastic discount factor
`D t = exp(-∫₀ᵗ r)`, the inverse of its bank account. `HJMModel.discount` is that factor as
`shortRateDiscount` of the integrated short rate, the object the contracts layer already prices
with (`Contract.valueDisc`), and `HJMModel.discount_eq_inv_bankAccount` identifies it with
`(bankAccount)⁻¹`.

A schedule of fixed cash flows sees the model only through the zero curve `𝔼[D tᵢ]`
(`valueDisc_fixedFlows_of_zeroCurve_eq`). Two results:

* `valueDisc_fixedFlows_hjm`: **conditional on the pricing hypothesis** `𝔼[D tᵢ] = P(0, tᵢ)`,
  where `P(0,·)` is the model's (deterministic) initial bond curve, the schedule is worth
  `∑ P(0, tᵢ) cᵢ`. That hypothesis is what the HJM drift condition delivers (the discounted bonds
  are martingales); it is *not* proved here and is an explicit hypothesis of the statement.
* `valueDisc_fixedFlows_hjm_flat`: unconditionally, for a deterministic flat forward curve
  `f(s,u) = r` (`s ≤ u`), the schedule is worth `∑ zcb r 0 tᵢ · cᵢ`.

## Main definitions

* `HJMModel.discount`: the stochastic discount factor `exp(-∫₀ᵗ f(s,s) ds)` of an HJM model.

## Main results

* `HJMModel.discount_eq_inv_bankAccount`: `discount t ω = (bankAccount t ω)⁻¹`.
* `valueDisc_fixedFlows_hjm`: fixed flows are worth `∑ P(0,tᵢ) cᵢ` given `𝔼[D tᵢ] = P(0,tᵢ)`.
* `valueDisc_fixedFlows_hjm_flat`: on a flat deterministic curve, they are worth `∑ zcb r 0 tᵢ cᵢ`.

discounted-bond martingale property that the HJM drift condition delivers, which is **not**
