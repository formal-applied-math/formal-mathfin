# The capital of the complete market's hedge is the contract's value

`isCompleteMarket_horizonSpot` (`Binomial/MultiPeriodFTAP.lean`) says that in the `N`-period tree
every claim on the first `N` flips is `x + ∑ φ_{t+1} (S̃_{t+1} − S̃_t)` for some capital `x` and
predictable strategy `φ`, but it names neither: `x` is whatever the second fundamental theorem
returns. For the claim of a European contract the capital is determined, and it is the contract's
value (`Contract.value`, `Contracts/Pricing.lean`): the equivalent martingale measure of the tree
is `horizonMeasure N (crrUpProb u d ρ)`, it prices the gains at zero
(`IsEMM.integrable_and_integral_gains`), so replication prices the claim at `x`
(`integral_eq_of_replicates`), and that price is the value, the expectation of the contract's
discounted payoff over coin-flip paths.

* `Binomial.exists_hedge_eq_value` — under no-arbitrage, for a European contract maturing on step
  `N`, the market's replication of its discounted payoff, read on the `N` flips, starts from the
  value `Contract.value (coinFlipMeasure q)`.

It is the finite-market counterpart of `Binomial.pathPV_eq_value_add_gains`
(`Contracts/Models/Binomial.lean`), which gives the hedge on the infinite path space from the
tree's backward recursion: there the value is built into the hedge by construction, here the
completeness theorem produces some hedge and the pricing argument shows its capital is the value.

/-- **In the complete tree the hedge's capital is the contract's value.** Under no-arbitrage and
`S₀ > 0`, take a European contract that pays `g` of the underlying at a time `T` falling on step
`N` (`T / h = N`). Its discounted payoff, as a claim on the first `N` flips (the path padded by
`false`, `padFlips`), is replicated, almost surely under any real-world law of i.i.d.
`Bernoulli(p)` flips with `0 < p < 1`, by a bounded predictable strategy `φ` in the discounted
spot `horizonSpot N`, from the initial capital `Contract.value` under the risk-neutral flips
`coinFlipMeasure q`, `q = crrUpProb u d ρ`. The strategy is not given in closed form: it comes
from the completeness of the market (`isCompleteMarket_horizonSpot`), and only its capital is
identified. -/
