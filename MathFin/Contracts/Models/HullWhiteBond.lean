# Bond prices at `t > 0` in the Hull–White model

For the Hull–White discount factor `D t = exp(−∫₀ᵗ r)` (`HullWhite.bondRate`, continuous forcing
`θ`) and the natural filtration of the driving Brownian motion, `bondPrice` is the affine form of
the time-`0` price of the forcing seen from `t`, at the remaining maturity (`bondPrice_hullWhite`),
read off the conditional Laplace transform of the Wiener integral
(`HullWhite.bondRate_condExp`):

  `P(t, T) = A_t(T − t)·exp(−B(T − t)·r_t)`,   `A_t = bondA (θ(t + ·))`.

It is the Hull–White counterpart of `bondPrice_vasicek` (`Contracts/Models/VasicekBond.lean`),
with the same proof; Vasicek is the constant forcing (`HullWhite.bondRate_const`).

## Main results

* `bondPrice_hullWhite` — `bondPrice` in the Hull–White model, almost surely.

/-- **The Hull–White bond price at time `t`.** With `D t = exp(−∫₀ᵗ r)` along the integrated
Hull–White rate for continuous forcing `θ` and `𝓕` the natural filtration of the driving Brownian
motion, the price at `t` of one unit paid at `T` is `P(t, T) = A_t(T − t)·exp(−B(T − t)·r_t)`
almost surely, where `r_t` is the short rate in its Wiener representation, `B` is Vasicek's
coefficient and `A_t = bondA (θ(t + ·))` is the coefficient of the time-`0` price
(`HullWhite.bondPrice_affine`) of the forcing shifted to `t`. The measure is read as the pricing
measure. -/
