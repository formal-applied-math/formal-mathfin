# The contracts priced in the binomial model

The second model for the instruments of `Contracts/Instruments/Options.lean`, after
`Contracts/Models/BlackScholes.lean`. The instruments are the same terms; only the model changes.

The binomial market with step length `h` is a model map on coin-flip paths `ω : ℕ → Bool`: at
time `t` the underlying is the spot after the `⌊t / h⌋` flips made by then,
`spotPath S₀ u d ⌊t / h⌋ ω`. Unlike `BlackScholes.assets` it is a genuine path, not a terminal
value read at every time, so a path-dependent instrument already has the model it needs. Cash
is discounted at `ρ` per step, and paths are drawn from `coinFlipMeasure q` with
`q = crrUpProb u d ρ`: i.i.d. flips, up with the risk-neutral probability. Everything about the
tree itself (the path measure, the spot's measurability and bound, the CRR sequence) lives in
`MathFin/Binomial/`; this file is only the translation of contracts into it.

A single cash flow paying `g` of the spot at a maturity `T` that falls on step `N` is worth the
backward-induction price `binomialPrice u d ρ g N S₀` (`value_pay_eq_binomialPrice`); this is
`binomialPrice_eq_integral_coinFlipMeasure`, which writes the tree price as an expectation over
paths. Every contract is integrable here, because the spot after finitely many flips is bounded
(`integrable_pathPV`), so a composed instrument is priced by composition with no integrability
side conditions to prove.

The value is also a price in the sense of replication. Under no-arbitrage, a European contract's
discounted payoff is, on every path, its value plus the gains of a predictable strategy in the
discounted spot (`pathPV_eq_value_add_gains`). The strategy comes from the tree
(`binomialPrice_replication`, `Binomial/EuropeanReplication.lean`).

## Main definitions

* `Binomial.assets` — the binomial market with step `h` as a model map.
* `Binomial.discount` — discounting at `ρ` per step.

## Main results

* `Binomial.value_pay_eq_binomialPrice` — a European payoff is worth its tree price.
* `Binomial.integrable_pathPV` — every contract's discounted payoff is integrable.
* `Binomial.value_europeanCall`, `value_europeanPut`, `value_digitalCall` — each is the tree
  price of its payoff.
* `Binomial.value_forward` — under no-arbitrage the forward is worth `S₀ − K e^{−ρN}`.
* `Binomial.value_cappedCall` — the capped call is worth the difference of two call values.
* `Binomial.pathPV_eq_value_add_gains` — a European contract's value is the cost of its hedge: on
  every path its discounted payoff is its value plus the gains of a predictable strategy in the
  discounted spot.

## Source

The layered separation of contract semantics from pricing semantics, and the
framing "the contract is not the model", are due to Paul Bilokon,
*The Contract Is Not the Model: Proof-Carrying Exotic Derivatives and the
Economics of Model Risk* (working paper, 9 August 2026; Mathematical
Finance, Imperial College London), with code at
<https://github.com/thalesians/lean_contracts> (Apache-2.0). That paper in
turn builds on the compositional contract-DSL of
Peyton Jones, Eber and Seward (2000) and the certified-contract work of Bahr,
Berthold and Elsman (2015) and Annenkov (2018).

No code is copied from `lean_contracts`; every definition and proof here is
written for this library. See `docs/specs/2026-08-16-contracts-tower-design.md`

/-- **A European contract's binomial value is the cost of its hedge.** Under no-arbitrage, with
paths drawn under the risk-neutral up-probability and `S₀ ≠ 0`, there is a predictable strategy
`H` (`H_{k+1}` depends only on the first `k` flips) such that, on every path, the contract's
discounted payoff is its value plus the strategy's gains in the discounted spot
`S̃_k = e^{−ρk} S_k`, its `martingaleTransform`:

  `pathPV = value + ∑_{k<N} H_{k+1} (S̃_{k+1} − S̃_k)`.

So the value is not only an expectation: it is the initial capital that replicates the
contract. -/
