# A quote process is priced by its own measure

A market maker who quotes the conditional expectation of the asset's value given the public
information `𝓖 n` (the Glosten–Milgrom zero-profit quote, `condExp_payoff_eq_quote` for one trade)
posts the price process `n ↦ P[V | 𝓖 n]`. This file reads that process as a market: it is the
discrete `Market` (`toMarket`) with the unit numéraire, and the measure `P` that defines the
quotes is a pricing measure of it, since a conditional expectation process is a `P`-martingale
(Mathlib's `martingale_condExp`).

## Main results

* `isPricingMeasure_toMarket_condExp`: for any probability measure `P` and filtration `𝓖`, `P`
  prices the market whose asset is `n ↦ P[V | 𝓖 n]`.

## Scope

The value `V` and the information `𝓖` are arbitrary; that the quotes of the Glosten–Milgrom
dealer along a sequence of trades are these conditional expectations is not shown here (one
trade is `condExp_payoff_eq_quote`).

/-- **The measure that defines the quotes prices them.** For a probability measure `P`, a
filtration `𝓖` and a value `V`, `P` is a pricing measure, at every horizon `T`, of the discrete
market whose asset is the quote process `n ↦ P[V | 𝓖 n]`: a conditional expectation process is a
`P`-martingale. -/
