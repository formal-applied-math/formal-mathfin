# Schwartz one-factor commodity futures

In the Schwartz (1997) one-factor model the log spot price of a commodity is
mean-reverting under the pricing measure:

  `d ln S_t = κ(θ − ln S_t) dt + σ dB_t`.

This is the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck dynamics of the Vasicek short rate, so, carrying
`ln S_T` in its Wiener representation (the SDE bridge is cited, not proven — see
`schwartzFuturesPrice_eq_integral`), it has the Gaussian law `N(m_T, v_T)` with
`m_T = vasicekSDEMean` and `v_T = vasicekSDEVariance` (`vasicekShortRate_hasLaw_gaussian`),
for `κ > 0`. The futures
price is `F(0,T) = E[S_T] = E[e^{ln S_T}]`, the Gaussian moment-generating
function at `1`:

  `F(0,T) = exp(m_T + v_T / 2)`.

In the Lean, `E` is the expectation under an arbitrary probability measure `μ` carrying the
Brownian motion: `μ` is *read* as the pricing measure, and that the futures price is
`E^Q[S_T]` is the textbook identification, not proved here. `schwartzFuturesPrice` is the
closed form, defined; `schwartzFuturesPrice_eq_integral` proves it equals `E[S_T]`.

As `T → ∞` (for `κ > 0`) the closed form flattens to `exp(θ + σ² / (4κ))`, independent of
the current spot.

This formalizes only the constant-parameter Schwartz (1997) model; Hull's
time-dependent level `q(t)` (the Hull–White-form drift calibrated to the
quoted futures curve) is out of scope.

## Main results

* `schwartzFuturesPrice` — the closed form `exp(m_T + v_T / 2)`.
* `schwartzFuturesPrice_eq_integral` — it equals `E[S_T]` for the log spot in its
  Wiener representation (the SDE bridge is cited, not proven).
