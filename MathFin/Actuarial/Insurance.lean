# Net premium principle and the life annuity-due

The **net premium principle** sets the periodic premium `P` of an insurance
contract by equating the present value of the premiums with the present value of
the benefits:

  `P · annuityFactor = benefitPV`,

so `P = benefitPV / annuityFactor` (`net_premium_principle`, Mathlib's `eq_div_iff`).

The annuity factor of `n` payments at the start of each period is the
**annuity-due** `ä_n = ∑_{k<n} vᵏ = (1 − vⁿ)/(1 − v)` for a per-period discount
factor `v ≠ 1` (`annuityDue_closed_form`, a geometric sum). The immediate annuity of
`FixedIncome/CouponBonds.lean` (`annuityValue`) pays one period later.

A **life annuity-due** pays only while the insured is alive:
`ä = ∑_{k<n} B(0, k) · S(k)` (`lifeAnnuityDue`), with the flat-rate zero-coupon bond
price `B(0, k) = zcb r 0 k` (`FixedIncome/ZCB.lean`) and the survival probability
`S(k) = survivalFromForce μ k = exp(−∫₀ᵏ μ)` of a force of mortality `μ`
(`Actuarial/Mortality.lean`). For a constant force `m`, survival is `e^{−mk}` and
discounting is `e^{−rk}`, so the life annuity-due is the annuity-certain at the
discount factor `e^{−(r + m)}`: a constant force of mortality acts as an addition to
the interest rate (`lifeAnnuityDue_const`). This is the discrete counterpart of the
risky annuity `riskyAnnuity_eq` of `FixedIncome/Cox.lean`, where a constant default
intensity adds to the rate in the same way.

`lifeAnnuityDue` is written directly as the sum `∑ B(0, k) S(k)`. That it is the
expected present value of the payments made to a random lifetime with survival
function `S` is the standard actuarial reading; it is not proved here.

## Main results

* `annuityDue_closed_form`: `Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} v^k = (1 − v^n)/(1 − v)` (geometric).
* `net_premium_principle`: `P · A = B ↔ P = B / A` for `A ≠ 0`.
* `lifeAnnuityDue`, `lifeAnnuityDue_const`: the life annuity-due, and its closed form
  under a constant force of mortality.
