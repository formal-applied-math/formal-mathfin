# Risk parity portfolio (two-asset closed form)

A risk-parity portfolio sets each asset's *contribution to variance*
`wᵢ (Σw)ᵢ` equal across assets. For two assets with positive volatilities `σ₁, σ₂`
and correlation `ρ`, the risk-parity weights under the budget constraint
`w₁ + w₂ = 1` with `w₁, w₂ > 0` are independent of `ρ`:

  `w₁^RP = σ₂ / (σ₁ + σ₂)`,
  `w₂^RP = σ₁ / (σ₁ + σ₂)`.

The independence from correlation is the surprising feature: only the
relative volatilities matter for equal-risk allocation.

Results:

* `riskParityWeightTwo`: definition `σ₂ / (σ₁ + σ₂)`.
* `risk_parity_equal_contribution`: at the RP weights, the two assets'
  contributions to portfolio variance are equal.
* `isRiskParity_two_iff`: with the covariance matrix `covTwo` (`Portfolio/Markowitz.lean`)
  and the risk-parity predicate `IsRiskParity` (`Portfolio/RiskParityFOC.lean`), a long-only
  budget portfolio has equal risk contributions iff `w₁ = σ₂ / (σ₁ + σ₂)`, for every `ρ`:
  the closed form is the only long-only two-asset risk-parity portfolio (when `σ₁ ≠ σ₂`, a
  budget portfolio with a short leg, `w₁σ₁ = −w₂σ₂`, also equalises contributions).

/-- **The two-asset risk-parity portfolio is unique.** For two assets with positive
volatilities and any correlation `ρ`, a long-only budget portfolio `(w₁, w₂)`
(`w₁, w₂ > 0`, `w₁ + w₂ = 1`) has equal risk contributions under `covTwo σ₁ σ₂ ρ`
(`IsRiskParity`) iff `w₁ = σ₂ / (σ₁ + σ₂)`. The reason is the factorisation
`RC₁ − RC₂ = (w₁σ₁ − w₂σ₂)(w₁σ₁ + w₂σ₂)`, in which the correlation terms cancel and the
second factor is positive. -/
