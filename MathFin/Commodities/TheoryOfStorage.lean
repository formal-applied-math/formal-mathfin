# Theory of storage: convenience yield and the canonical-storage price kink

The **theory of storage** (Kaldor 1939, Working 1949) models the commodity spot
price as a kinked function of "availability" `A` (current stock plus expected
supply). For availability below the kink point `A*` (scarcity) the price tracks
the inverse demand-for-storage curve `f⁻¹(A)`, which falls as availability
rises; at and above `A*` storage is profitable and the market sits at the
investment-regime price floor `Sbar = E[S_{t+1}] − C`:

  `S(A) = max(Sbar, f⁻¹(A))`                         (canonical-storage price)
  `Y(A) = max(f⁻¹(A) − Sbar, 0)`                      (convenience yield)

By definition the convenience yield is positive exactly where `f⁻¹(A) > Sbar`
and zero elsewhere; for a decreasing `f⁻¹` that is where scarcity bites, below
the kink. The definitions here take any `f⁻¹ : ℝ → ℝ`: no monotonicity of `f⁻¹`
is assumed, and nothing is proved about `A` below or above `A*`. The two
functions are two faces of the same kink: `Y(A) = S(A) − Sbar` always.

The forward is derived, not posited, from the library's no-arbitrage forward
(`forward_price_from_no_arbitrage`, `Foundations/NoArbitrageDerivations.lean`). In a
finite-state market with state prices `q` and discount factor `DF = ∑ q`, suppose holding one
unit of the stored commodity to the delivery date is priced at the spot `S₀`: it delivers
the commodity `S_T`, the convenience yield `Y`, and costs the storage `C`, both `Y` and `C`
deterministic and paid at delivery (`∑ q·(S_T − C + Y) = S₀`). Then the forward strike
with zero value is `F = S₀/DF + C − Y` (`storageForward_from_no_arbitrage`). With zero rates
(`DF = 1`), spot `S₀ = S(A)` and `Y = Y(A)`, this gives `F = Sbar + C` at every availability
(`storageForward_at_availability`), and the cost-of-carry identity — the spot price `S(A)`
plus the finance/storage cost `C` net of the convenience-yield benefit — is the kink
identity rearranged:

  `F − S(A) = C − Y(A)`

(convenience yield *reduces* net carry cost — high-yield, near-backwardation
markets have `Y(A)` large relative to `C`. This is the standard sign
convention in the literature: convenience yield is a benefit to the holder
of physical stock, so it subtracts from the holder's net financing cost,
i.e. from `C`).

For an isoelastic demand-for-storage curve
`f⁻¹(A) = p_ref · (a_ref / A) ^ ε` (flexibility `ε = −d ln p / d ln A`,
reference availability `a_ref`, reference price `p_ref`), a kink point `A*`
with `f⁻¹(A*) = Sbar` is

  `A* = a_ref · (p_ref / Sbar) ^ {1/ε}`

for `a_ref, p_ref, Sbar > 0` and `ε ≠ 0` (`kinkPoint_spec`); that it is the
only crossing is not stated.

## Main results

* `storageSpotPrice`, `convenienceYield`: the two kinked functions, generic
  in the inverse demand-for-storage curve `f⁻¹ : ℝ → ℝ`.
* `convenienceYield_eq_storageSpotPrice_sub` : `Y(A) = S(A) − Sbar`.
* `carry_identity_at_availability` : `(Sbar + C) − S(A) = C − Y(A)`, the
  cost-of-carry identity at the kink functions
  (`convenienceYield_eq_storageSpotPrice_sub` rearranged).
* `storageForward_from_no_arbitrage` : in a finite-state market whose stored commodity
  is priced with storage cost `C` and convenience yield `Y` paid at delivery, the
  zero-value forward strike is `F = S₀/DF + C − Y`.
* `storageForward_at_availability` : with zero rates, spot `S(A)` and convenience
  yield `Y(A)`, the zero-value forward strike is `Sbar + C` at every availability `A`.
* `invDemandIsoelastic`, `kinkPoint`, `kinkPoint_spec` : the isoelastic
  demand-for-storage curve and a kink point solving `f⁻¹(A*) = Sbar`, for
  `a_ref, p_ref, Sbar > 0` and `ε ≠ 0`.

/-! ### Canonical-storage spot price and convenience yield -/

/-- **Canonical-storage spot price**: the price sits at the investment-regime
floor `Sbar` when the inverse demand-for-storage curve `f⁻¹` would call for
less, else tracks it. -/
noncomputable def storageSpotPrice (Sbar : ℝ) (invDemand : ℝ → ℝ) (A : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  max Sbar (invDemand A)

/-- **Convenience yield**: positive exactly where scarcity pushes the
demand-for-storage price above the investment-regime floor (`f⁻¹(A) > Sbar`),
zero where it does not. -/
noncomputable def convenienceYield (Sbar : ℝ) (invDemand : ℝ → ℝ) (A : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  max (invDemand A - Sbar) 0

/-- The convenience yield is exactly how far the canonical-storage price sits
above the floor `Sbar` — the two kinks are one and the same. -/

/-! ### Cost-of-carry identity -/

/-- **Carry identity at a given availability**: at the forward `F = Sbar + C` (cost of
carry off the investment-regime floor; derived from no-arbitrage in
`storageForward_at_availability`), the carry spread against the canonical-storage spot
price is exactly `C − Y(A)` — convenience yield subtracts from the carry cost `C`, the
standard theory-of-storage sign convention (convenience yield is a benefit to the holder of
physical stock). The identity is `convenienceYield_eq_storageSpotPrice_sub` rearranged. -/

/-! ### The forward from no-arbitrage -/

/-- **Cost of carry with storage cost and convenience yield, from no-arbitrage.** In a
finite-state market with state prices `q`, discount factor `∑ q = DF ≠ 0`, terminal commodity
prices `S`, and the stored commodity priced at the spot `S₀` as the claim on
`S_T − C + Y` (the commodity, less the storage cost `C`, plus the convenience yield `Y`, both
deterministic and paid at delivery), the forward with strike `F` has zero value exactly when
`F = S₀/DF + C − Y`. The library's forward `forward_price_from_no_arbitrage` applied to the
stored-commodity claim, shifted by the deterministic carry `Y − C`. -/

/-- **The forward does not see availability.** With zero rates (`∑ q = 1`), the spot at the
canonical-storage price `S(A)` and the convenience yield `Y(A)` of the same kink, the
zero-value forward strike is `Sbar + C` at every availability `A`: the convenience yield
offsets exactly the scarcity premium of the spot over the floor. This derives the forward
`F = Sbar + C` at which `carry_identity_at_availability` is stated. -/

/-- **Kink-point equation**: `f⁻¹(A*) = Sbar`, i.e. the isoelastic
demand-for-storage curve meets the floor at `kinkPoint` (uniqueness of the
crossing is not stated). -/
