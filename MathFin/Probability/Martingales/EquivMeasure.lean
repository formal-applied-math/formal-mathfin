# Equivalent probability measures, and the one from a positive normalised density

`IsEquivProbMeasure P Q` (`Q` a probability measure with `Q ≪ P` and `P ≪ Q`) is the prefix every
equivalent-martingale-measure structure of the library extends.

A strictly-positive, `P`-integrable density `g` with `∫ g ∂P = 1` defines an
**equivalent probability measure** `P.withDensity (fun ω ↦ ENNReal.ofReal (g ω))`: it is a
probability measure (total mass `∫ g = 1`) and mutually absolutely continuous with `P`
(`withDensity` is always `≪ P`, and `P ≪` it because the density is a.e. nonzero).

This is the change-of-measure ritual shared by the equivalent-martingale-measure constructions
in the one-period FTAP files (`FTAPOnePeriod.lean`, `FTAPOnePeriodVector.lean`): each builds its
fair density (a logistic Esscher weight, or a `(1+‖Y‖)⁻¹` tempering for the `L¹` reduction),
normalises it, and then needs exactly `IsEquivProbMeasure P Q`.

An equivalence on a sub-σ-algebra `m` extends to the whole space: `P` weighted by the density
`d(Q|m)/d(P|m)` of the restrictions is equivalent to `P` everywhere and is `Q` on `m`
(`exists_isEquivProbMeasure_trim_eq`). A pricing measure up to a horizon `T` need only be equivalent
to the reference measure on the information `𝓕 T`, and this is how it meets the theorems stated for
measures equivalent on the whole space.

## Main definitions

* `IsEquivProbMeasure`: `Q` is a probability measure with `Q ≪ P` and `P ≪ Q`.

## Main results

* `absolutelyContinuous_withDensity_ofReal`: an a.e. strictly positive density makes `P`
  absolutely continuous with respect to `P.withDensity (ofReal g)`.
* `isEquivProbMeasure_withDensity_of_isProbabilityMeasure`: `P.withDensity (ofReal g)` for an a.e.
  strictly positive density `g` is equivalent to `P` as soon as it is a probability measure.
* `isEquivProbMeasure_withDensity`: for a strictly positive, `P`-integrable `g` with `∫ g ∂P = 1`,
  `P.withDensity (ofReal g)` is an equivalent probability measure.
* `trim_withDensity_rnDeriv_trim`: `P` weighted by `d(Q|m)/d(P|m)` restricts to `Q|m` on `m`, when
  `Q|m ≪ P|m`.
* `integral_rnDeriv_trim_mul`: `∫ (d(Q|m)/d(P|m)) * g ∂P = ∫ g ∂Q` for `m`-measurable `g`, when
  `Q|m ≪ P|m`.
* `exists_isEquivProbMeasure_trim_eq`: a probability measure equivalent to `P` on a sub-σ-algebra
  agrees there with one equivalent to `P` on the whole space.

/-- A density that is a.e. strictly positive makes `P` absolutely continuous with respect to
`P.withDensity (fun ω ↦ ENNReal.ofReal (g ω))`: the density vanishes only on a `P`-null set.
(The other direction, `withDensity ≪ P`, is `withDensity_absolutelyContinuous` and needs
nothing.) -/

/-- `Q` is an **equivalent probability measure** for `P`: a probability measure with the same null
sets, `Q ≪ P` and `P ≪ Q`. The prefix shared by every equivalent-martingale-measure structure of
the library (`IsEMM`, at every time index, and `OnePeriodVector.IsEMM`), which `extend` it. -/

/-- `Q = P.withDensity (ofReal g)` for an a.e. strictly positive density `g` is an equivalent
probability measure as soon as it is a probability measure: `≪ P` holds for every density
(`withDensity_absolutelyContinuous`), `P ≪` by positivity
(`absolutelyContinuous_withDensity_ofReal`). -/

`Q = P.withDensity (fun ω ↦ ENNReal.ofReal (g ω))` a probability measure equivalent to `P`.
(Measurability is not assumed: the integrability of `g` already makes it a.e.-measurable, which
is all `withDensity` needs.) -/
