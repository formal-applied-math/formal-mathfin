# The law of a finite weight vector

`Measure.ofWeights s p` is the measure `∑ i ∈ s, p i • δ_i` with the weights `p i` on the finite
set `s`: the single adaptor between the library's `Finset`-indexed weight vectors (probabilities,
state prices, spectral weights) and Mathlib's measures. For non-negative weights its integral is
the weighted sum, `∫ f ∂ofWeights s p = ∑ i ∈ s, p i * f i`, so a statement about weighted sums is
a statement about an integral, and a finite measure on a finite space is the law of its own
point masses (`ofWeights_univ_real_singleton`).

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.ofWeights`: the measure `∑ i ∈ s, ofReal (p i) • dirac i`.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.integral_ofWeights`: `∫ f ∂ofWeights s p = ∑ i ∈ s, p i * f i` for
  non-negative weights.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.isProbabilityMeasure_ofWeights`: weights summing to one give a
  probability measure.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.ofWeights_univ_real_singleton`: a finite measure on a finite type with
  measurable singletons is `ofWeights univ (fun i ↦ μ.real {i})`.
