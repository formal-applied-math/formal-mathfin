# Dai (MakerDAO): liquidation inequality and stability-fee compounding

Adapted from the MakerDAO whitepaper (Maker, "The Maker Protocol:
MakerDAO's Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) System", 2020,
<https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper>): the collateralization /
liquidation criterion from the "Liquidation of Risky Maker Vaults" section,
and the "Liquidation Ratio" / "Stability Fee" parameter entries under
"Risk Parameters Controlled by Maker Governance" (these are named
parameter entries, not sub-sections of the paper).

## Results

* `isLiquidatable`: the predicate `collateral / debt < liquidationRatio`.
* `isLiquidatable_iff_mul`: cross-multiplied equivalent form (no division), for
  `debt > 0`.
* `debt_eq_debt_zero_mul_pow`: the compounding recurrence
  `debt (n+1) = debt n · (1 + fee)` has closed form `debt n = debt 0 · (1+fee)^n`
  (the library's `eq_mul_pow_of_succ`, `FixedIncome/PeriodicCompounding.lean`).
* `debt_mul_zcb_log_eq`: per-period stability-fee compounding *is* continuous compounding at
  the rate `log (1 + fee)`: discounting the debt after `n` periods by the zero-coupon bond
  `zcb (log (1 + fee)) 0 n` returns the initial debt, for `fee > −1`. The Multi-Collateral Dai
  `Jug` compounds its per-second rate (`duty`) over the elapsed seconds, so a period here is a
  second and `log (1 + fee)` is the continuously compounded per-second rate.

The probability that a vault with lognormal collateral is liquidatable at a horizon is in
`MathFin/Bridges/LiquidationAsStructuralDefault.lean` (`prob_isLiquidatable_eq_kmvPD`).

/-- **Dai stability-fee compounding**: given a vault-debt sequence
satisfying `debt (n+1) = debt n · (1 + fee)` at every step, the debt after
`n` periods equals the initial debt compounded at the per-period stability
fee, `debt n = debt 0 · (1 + fee)^n`: the closed form of a per-period accrual index,

vault debt compounds at the per-period fee `fee > −1`, then discounting the debt after `n`
