# Compound: utilization, affine borrow rate, cToken exchange-rate monotonicity

Adapted from the Compound whitepaper (R. Leshner and G. Hayes, "Compound: The Money
Market Protocol", v1.0, February 2019): §2.3 Interest Rate Model (utilization,
affine borrow rate), §3.1 cToken Contracts (exchange rate) and §3.2.1 Market Dynamics
(interest-rate index, reserve-factor accrual).

## Results

* `utilization`: `U = Borrows / (Cash + Borrows)`, matching the whitepaper's
  §2.3 definition exactly. (The deployed `BaseJumpRateModelV2` contract nets
  reserves out of the denominator, `Borrows / (Cash + Borrows − Reserves)`;
  this file follows the whitepaper, not that later on-chain refinement.)
* `utilization_mem_Icc`: for nonnegative cash and borrows, `U ∈ [0, 1]`.
* `borrowRate`, `borrowRate_monotone`: the affine rate `r = base + slope · U`,
  monotone in `U` when `slope ≥ 0`.
* `exchangeRate`: `(Cash + Borrows − Reserves) / TotalSupply`.
* `exchangeRate_mono`: over one accrual period, with cash and a positive total
  supply unchanged, the exchange rate does not decrease, **under the explicit
  hypothesis that the reserve-factor cut does not exceed the accrued
  interest** (`reservesAdded ≤ interest`) — the whitepaper's reserve-factor
  accrual equations give this (`reservesAdded = interest · reserveFactor` with
  `reserveFactor ∈ [0,1]` and `interest ≥ 0`), but it is stated as a standalone
  hypothesis on the accrued amounts rather than re-derived from `reserveFactor`.
* `borrowIndex_eq_mul_pow`, `borrowIndex_le_inv_zcb`, `tendsto_borrowIndex`: the interest-rate
  index of §3.2.1, `Index_n = Index_{n−1} · (1 + r·t)` at a per-block rate `r` over periods of
  length `t`, against the library's zero-coupon bond (`FixedIncome/PeriodicCompounding.lean`):
  at a constant rate it is `Index_0 · (1 + r t)^n`, never above continuous compounding
  `Index_0 / zcb r 0 (n t)`, and accruing a horizon `T` in `n` equal periods converges to
  `Index_0 / zcb r 0 T`. Rates that change between periods are not covered.

/-- **Compound utilization rate**: the fraction of the pool's assets
(cash + outstanding borrows) that is currently borrowed out, per the
whitepaper's §2.3 definition. (The deployed interest-rate-model contract
additionally nets reserves out of the denominator; that refinement is not
formalized here.) -/
noncomputable def utilization (cash borrows : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  borrows / (cash + borrows)

/-- For nonnegative cash and borrows the utilization lies in `[0, 1]` (it is `0` for an
empty pool, by the `x / 0 = 0` convention). -/

/-- **Compound affine borrow-rate model**: `r(U) = base + slope · U`. Takes
`U` directly (rather than `cash`/`borrows`) so it applies uniformly whether
`U` comes from `utilization` or from the on-chain reserves-netted refinement
noted on `utilization`. -/

/-- **cToken exchange-rate monotonicity under interest accrual.**
Suppose a period accrues `interest` of new borrows, of which
`reservesAdded` is cut to reserves. **Explicit hypothesis**
`reservesAdded ≤ interest` — the whitepaper's reserve-factor accrual equations give
this (`reservesAdded = interest · reserveFactor` with `reserveFactor ∈ [0,1]` and
`interest ≥ 0`), but we state it as a standalone hypothesis on the
accrued amounts rather than re-deriving it from `reserveFactor` here. Under
it, with cash and supply unchanged and `totalSupply > 0`, the exchange rate after
accrual is at least the rate before. -/

/-- **Compound interest-rate index** (whitepaper §3.2.1, Market Dynamics): each transaction
compounds the index by the interest for the period, `Index_n = Index_{n−1} · (1 + r·t)`. At a
constant per-block rate `r` and period length `t`, the index is `Index_0 · (1 + r t)^n`. -/

/-- **Per-period accrual never exceeds continuous compounding at the same rate.** At a constant
rate `r` with `r t ≥ −1` and a nonnegative initial index, after `n` periods of length `t` the
index is at most `Index_0 / zcb r 0 (n t) = Index_0 · exp (r · n t)`. -/

/-- **Accruing ever more often converges to continuous compounding.** Splitting a horizon `T`
into `n` equal accrual periods at the constant rate `r`, the index `Index_0 · (1 + r (T/n))^n`
tends to `Index_0 / zcb r 0 T = Index_0 · exp (r T)`. -/
