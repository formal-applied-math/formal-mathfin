# The Kelly (growth-optimal) portfolio as numéraire ⟹ the risk-neutral measure

The growth-optimal (log-optimal) portfolio is the **numéraire portfolio**: deflating
the physical measure by the growth-optimal wealth turns it into the equivalent
martingale measure (Long 1990 / Platen's benchmark approach). This file realizes that
identity in the two-outcome Kelly market — the discrete, fully elementary shadow of the
continuous statement (which needs a state-price-density / market model absent from the
Itô tower).

Setup (`Choice/Performance/Ratios`): a binary bet at fraction `f` pays odds `b` (wealth
multiplier `1 + f·b`) with physical probability `p`, or loses the stake (multiplier
`1 - f`) with probability `1 - p`. The **Kelly fraction** `f* = kellyFraction p b`
maximizes the expected log-growth `kellyGrowth p b` — its first-order optimality is
`kellyGrowth_deriv_at_kelly`. The growth-optimal terminal wealths are

  `W*₊ = 1 + f*·b`   (winning state),   `W*₋ = 1 - f*`   (losing state).

**Deflating the physical measure by `W*`** (dividing each state's physical probability
by the growth-optimal wealth there) gives `q₊ = p/W*₊`, `q₋ = (1-p)/W*₋`. The punchline:

  `q₊ = 1/(b+1)`,   `q₋ = b/(b+1)`   — **independent of the physical `p`** —

the unique *fair-odds* (risk-neutral) probabilities for a bet paying `b`-to-`1`. They sum
to `1` (a probability measure) and price the bet as a martingale
(`q₊·b + q₋·(−1) = 0`, zero expected excess return): the GOP-deflated measure **is** the
EMM. The `p`-independence is exactly the content of the Kelly first-order condition —
`1 + f*·b = p·(b+1)`, so the physical `p` cancels in the deflation. Change the numéraire
to the growth-optimal portfolio and the physical measure becomes risk-neutral.

## Main results

* `kellyGOPWealth_win`, `kellyGOPWealth_lose` — the growth-optimal terminal wealths
  `W*₊ = p(b+1)` and `W*₋ = (1-p)(b+1)/b` (the Kelly first-order condition made explicit).
* `kellyDeflatedProb_win`, `kellyDeflatedProb_lose` — the GOP-deflated probabilities
  `q₊ = 1/(b+1)`, `q₋ = b/(b+1)`.
* `kellyDeflatedProb_sum_one` — `q₊ + q₋ = 1` (a probability measure).
* `kellyNumeraire_isRiskNeutral` — `q₊·b + q₋·(−1) = 0`: under the GOP-deflated probabilities
  the one-period bet has zero mean, the numéraire-portfolio ⟹ EMM identity in one period.

first-order condition (`kellyGrowth_deriv_at_kelly`) made explicit: the physical `p`
appears as the whole factor, which is what lets it cancel in the deflation below. -/

/-- **The Kelly numéraire portfolio induces the risk-neutral measure.** Under the
GOP-deflated measure `q₊ = p/W*₊`, `q₋ = (1-p)/W*₋`, the bet's excess return has zero
mean:

  `q₊·b + q₋·(−1) = 0`,

i.e. the discounted asset is a `q`-martingale — `q` is the equivalent martingale
measure. This is the (discrete, two-outcome) **numéraire-portfolio ⟹ EMM** identity: the
growth-optimal portfolio is the numéraire whose deflator turns the physical measure into
the EMM, the risk-neutrality being exactly the vanishing of the Kelly first-order
condition (`kellyGrowth_deriv_at_kelly`). -/
