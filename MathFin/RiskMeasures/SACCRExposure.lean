# Basel SA-CCR: exposure at default and effective notional aggregation

The Basel III **Standardised Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk** (SA-CCR, BCBS 279)
computes the exposure at default of a derivatives netting set as

  `EAD = α · (RC + PFE)`,

where `RC` is the replacement cost, `PFE` is the potential future exposure add-on, and the
regulator fixes `α = 1.4`. Here `RC` and `PFE` enter as free real numbers: their construction
from supervisory factors (the replacement cost, the PFE multiplier, the asset-class add-ons) is not
formalized, apart from the two-bucket interest-rate effective notional below. We record the
formula and its one structural fact: `EAD` is nondecreasing in `RC` and in `PFE`, jointly, for any
fixed `α ≥ 0`, so netting or hedging that lowers one component without raising the other can only
lower (never raise) the capital exposure.

The other SA-CCR building block with algebraic content is the **effective notional** of an
interest-rate hedging set. SA-CCR splits the trades of one currency into three maturity buckets
(under one year, one to five years, over five years) with signed bucket effective notionals
`D₁, D₂, D₃`, and aggregates them as

  `EffectiveNotional = √(D₁² + D₂² + D₃² + 1.4·D₁·D₂ + 1.4·D₂·D₃ + 0.6·D₁·D₃)`,

that is, with correlation `0.7` between adjacent buckets and `0.3` between the first and the third
(Basel Framework CRE52.57). This is `effNotionalIR`, and it never exceeds `|D₁| + |D₂| + |D₃|`
(`effNotionalIR_le_abs_add`). With one bucket empty it is

  `effNotionalPair ρ d₁ d₂ = √(d₁² + d₂² + 2ρ·d₁·d₂)`

at `ρ = 0.7` (third bucket empty, `effNotionalIR_third_zero`) or `ρ = 0.3` (middle bucket empty,
`effNotionalIR_second_zero`). The two-bucket form is the same quadratic form
as the standard deviation of a sum of two correlated risks. It is not the single-factor
aggregation that SA-CCR uses for the credit, equity and commodity classes,
`√((Σₖ ρₖ·Aₖ)² + Σₖ (1 − ρₖ²)·Aₖ²)` over entity-level add-ons `Aₖ`, whose two-entity cross term
with equal `ρ` is `2ρ²·A₁·A₂`. We prove that `effNotionalPair` collapses to `|d₁ + d₂|` at `ρ = 1`
(full correlation, no diversification benefit) and to `√(d₁² + d₂²)` at `ρ = 0`, that it never
exceeds `|d₁| + |d₂|` for `ρ ∈ [-1, 1]` (no *negative* diversification: recognising offset across
buckets never gives more than adding the absolute bucket notionals), and that for `ρ ≥ 0` and both
notionals nonnegative, growing `d₁` never shrinks the aggregate (`effNotionalPair_mono_left`; the
formula is symmetric in `d₁, d₂`, so the same holds for `d₂` by relabelling; that version is not
stated).

**The effective notional is a standard deviation.** Its radicand is the Markowitz quadratic form
`∑ᵢⱼ DᵢDⱼρᵢⱼ` (`portfolioVarN`, `Portfolio/MarkowitzNAsset.lean`) of the bucket notionals under the
supervisory correlation matrix `saccrIRCorrelation` (`effNotionalIR_eq_sqrt_portfolioVarN`). So if
the three bucket risk factors `Zᵢ` have unit variances and the supervisory correlations as
covariances, `effNotionalIR` is the standard deviation of the hedging-set exposure `∑ Dᵢ Zᵢ`
(`effNotionalIR_eq_sqrt_variance`, through `portfolioVarN_covariance_eq_variance` of
`Portfolio/CovariancePSD.lean`). The supervisory matrix is positive semidefinite: the radicand is
a sum of squares, nonnegative for every hedging set, so the square root never truncates
(`effNotionalIR_radicand_nonneg`, `effNotionalIR_sq`). The bound "never more than adding the
absolute notionals" holds for every kernel with entries in `[-1, 1]`
(`sqrt_portfolioVarN_le_sum_abs`), and both `effNotionalIR_le_abs_add` and
`effNotionalPair_le_abs_add` are proved as its instances. The bucket risk factors themselves are
not part of the Basel formula; the theorem says which variance the formula computes.

## Main definitions

* `saccrEAD`: `α · (RC + PFE)`.
* `effNotionalIR`: the CRE52.57 interest-rate effective notional of three maturity buckets.
* `effNotionalPair`: the two-bucket aggregation `√(d₁² + d₂² + 2ρ·d₁·d₂)` at a general `ρ`.
* `saccrIRCorrelation`: the CRE52.57 correlation matrix of the three maturity buckets.

## Main results

* `saccrEAD_mono_rc`, `saccrEAD_mono_pfe`: `EAD` is monotone in `RC` and in `PFE` for `α ≥ 0`.
* `saccrEAD_mono`: `EAD` is jointly monotone in `(RC, PFE)` for `α ≥ 0`.
* `effNotionalPair_nonneg`: the aggregated notional is nonnegative.
* `effNotionalPair_eq_abs_add_of_corr_one`: at `ρ = 1`, `effNotionalPair = |d₁ + d₂|`.
* `effNotionalPair_eq_hypot_of_corr_zero`: at `ρ = 0`, `effNotionalPair = √(d₁² + d₂²)`.
* `effNotionalPair_le_abs_add`: for `ρ ∈ [-1, 1]`, the aggregation never exceeds `|d₁| + |d₂|` (no
  negative diversification).
* `effNotionalPair_mono_left`: for `ρ ≥ 0` and `d₂ ≥ 0`, the aggregation is monotone in `d₁` on
  `[0, ∞)`.
* `effNotionalIR_le_abs_add`: the three-bucket effective notional never exceeds
  `|D₁| + |D₂| + |D₃|`.
* `effNotionalIR_third_zero`, `effNotionalIR_second_zero`: with one bucket empty it is
  `effNotionalPair` at `0.7` or `0.3`.
* `sqrt_portfolioVarN_le_sum_abs`: for a kernel with entries in `[-1, 1]`, the square root of the
  quadratic form never exceeds the sum of the absolute weights.
* `effNotionalIR_eq_sqrt_portfolioVarN`, `effNotionalPair_eq_sqrt_portfolioVarN`: the effective
  notionals as square roots of Markowitz quadratic forms.
* `effNotionalIR_eq_sqrt_variance`: the effective notional is the standard deviation of the
  hedging-set exposure under unit-variance factors with the supervisory correlations.
* `effNotionalIR_radicand_nonneg`, `effNotionalIR_sq`: the supervisory correlation matrix is
  positive semidefinite, and the effective notional squares to its radicand.

SA-CCR aggregates the signed maturity-bucket effective notionals of an interest-rate hedging set
with correlation `0.7` between adjacent buckets and `0.3` between the first and the third
(CRE52.57, `effNotionalIR` at the end of this section). `effNotionalPair` below is the
two-bucket quadratic form for a general correlation `ρ`; at `ρ = 0.7` or `ρ = 0.3` it is that
aggregation with one bucket empty (`effNotionalIR_third_zero`, `effNotionalIR_second_zero`). -/

it is the interest-rate effective notional `effNotionalIR` of Basel Framework CRE52.57 for a
