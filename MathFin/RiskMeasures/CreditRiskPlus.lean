# The CreditRisk+ sector loss MGF

In CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse First Boston, *CreditRisk+: A Credit Risk Management Framework*,
1997) the number of defaults in a sector is Poisson with a random intensity `Λ ∼ Gamma(a, r)`,
and each default causes a loss drawn independently from a common severity law. The sector loss
`L = ∑_{i < N} Xᵢ` is then a compound Poisson sum whose Poisson intensity is mixed against the
Gamma law.

This file joins the two layers the library already has. The MGF of the `n`-loss sum is
`M_X(t)ⁿ` (`mgf_range_sum_of_iid`, `Actuarial/CompoundPoissonMGF.lean`), so the mixture is the
Poisson–Gamma sector pgf (`integral_integral_pow_poissonMeasure_gammaMeasure`,
`Foundations/GammaPoissonMixturePgf.lean`) evaluated at `z = M_X(t)`. For `M_X(t) < r + 1`,

  `∫ λ, (∫ n, M_{∑_{i<n} Xᵢ}(t) dPoisson(λ)) dGamma(a, r) = (r / (r − (M_X(t) − 1)))^a`

(`integral_compoundPoisson_mgf_gammaMeasure`). Equivalently, given `Λ = λ` the inner integral is
the compound-Poisson MGF `exp(λ (M_X(t) − 1))` (`compoundPoisson_mgf`), and the outer integral is
the Gamma moment-generating function at `M_X(t) − 1`.

Scope: the statement is the iterated (mixture) integral. A random sector count `N` with this
conditional law, the sector loss `L` as a random variable, the portfolio across independent sectors
and CreditRisk+'s loss-banding recursion are not constructed.
