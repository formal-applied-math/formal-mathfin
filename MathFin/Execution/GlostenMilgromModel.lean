# A model satisfying the Glosten-Milgrom hypotheses

`MathFin.Execution.spread_pos_of_model` quantifies over a probability space and
three events tied together by four equations. If nothing satisfies those
equations the theorem is vacuously true and says nothing — which is the same
failure mode the module it belongs to exists to warn about, one level up.

This file removes the doubt by exhibiting the model. Six outcomes: the value is
high or low, the arriving trader is informed or not, and an uninformed trader
tosses a coin.

| `i` | value | trader     | acts | mass           |
|-----|-------|------------|------|----------------|
| `0` | high  | informed   | buy  | `θp`           |
| `1` | high  | uninformed | buy  | `θ(1-p)/2`     |
| `2` | high  | uninformed | sell | `θ(1-p)/2`     |
| `3` | low   | informed   | sell | `(1-θ)p`       |
| `4` | low   | uninformed | buy  | `(1-θ)(1-p)/2` |
| `5` | low   | uninformed | sell | `(1-θ)(1-p)/2` |

The witness is symbolic: it works for *every* `0 < θ < 1` and `0 < p ≤ 1`, not
at one convenient point.

## Results

* `gmMeasure`, `gmHigh`, `gmBuy`, `gmInformed`: the space, and the three events.
* `gm_buy_inter_inf`: an informed trader buys exactly when the value is high —
  on this space, a set identity.
* `gmMeasure_univ_eq_one`: the six masses add to one.
* `spread_pos_witness`: the spread is strictly positive, with no
  measure-theoretic hypothesis left in front of it.
