# Roll (1984): the bid-ask bounce spread estimator

Roll's model of a mid-price `m_t` contaminated by bid-ask bounce: the observed trade price is

`P_t = m_t + (s/2) * q_t`,

where `s ≥ 0` is the (constant) bid-ask spread and `q_t ∈ {-1, +1}` is the trade-direction
indicator (buy/sell), modelled as a fair random sign (`rademacher`, from
`MathFin.Foundations.CorrelationFallacies`). Roll's economic assumptions — stated here as
explicit, named hypotheses, since the original note leaves them implicit — are:

* the signs `q_t` have the `rademacher` law (pairwise independent fair coin flips across time —
  joint independence is never used);
* every pair of the five variables drawn from the two consecutive price changes that *splits
  across* the two changes (one variable feeding `ΔP_t`, the other `ΔP_{t-1}`) is independent,
  *except* the sign shared by the two changes with itself; independence *within* a single price
  change is not assumed.

The mid-price increments are also assumed square-integrable, so that the covariances exist.
Under these hypotheses the first-order autocovariance of the *trade-price change*
`ΔP_t = P_t - P_{t-1}` is `-(s/2)²`, nonpositive and strictly negative whenever `s ≠ 0`:

`Cov(ΔP_t, ΔP_{t-1}) = -(s/2)²`.

This is `covariance_rollPriceChange`. Covariance is bilinear and translation-invariant, so the
mean of the mid-price increments plays no role; only independence matters. Expanding the product and
discarding every covariance between independent variables leaves exactly one surviving term: the
own-covariance (variance) of the sign `q_{t-1}` shared between the two consecutive price changes,
whose variance is `1` (`variance_one_of_hasLaw_rademacher`). The identity is usually inverted into
the **Roll estimator** `ŝ = 2 √(-γ̂₁)` of the spread from the sample first-order autocovariance
`γ̂₁` of observed price changes; `rollSpread_eq_two_mul_sqrt` records the inversion at the level of
the model's covariance (`s = 2 √(-γ)` whenever `γ = -(s/2)²` and `s ≥ 0`). No sample
autocovariance, and no property of `ŝ` as an estimator, is formalized.

We state the result for three consecutive sign variables `q0 q1 q2` (representing
`q_{t-2}, q_{t-1}, q_t`) and two increments `dm1 dm2` (`Δm_{t-1}, Δm_t`), rather than threading a
time index through a stochastic process, since only these five variables and their pairwise
independence ever enter the computation.

The inversion is only meaningful when the sample autocovariance `γ̂₁` is nonpositive, as the model
predicts. If `γ̂₁ > 0` — which real data can and does produce, since the model is an
approximation — no `s` satisfies the hypothesis `γ = -(s/2)²` of `rollSpread_eq_two_mul_sqrt`, and
`Real.sqrt` of the negative argument `-γ̂₁` returns `0` by Mathlib's junk-value convention, so
naively evaluating `2 * Real.sqrt (-γ̂₁)` at `γ̂₁ > 0` silently yields a spread estimate of `0`
rather than signalling that the estimator is undefined there.

## Main results

* `variance_id_rademacher`, `variance_one_of_hasLaw_rademacher`: a fair random sign has variance
  `1`.
* `covariance_rollPriceChange`: `Cov(ΔP_t, ΔP_{t-1}) = -(s/2)²` under the stated law,
  integrability and independence hypotheses.
* `rollSpread_eq_two_mul_sqrt`: the algebraic inversion `s = 2 * √(-γ)` for `s ≥ 0` and any real
  `γ = -(s/2)²`; with `covariance_rollPriceChange` it gives `s = 2 * √(-Cov(ΔP_t, ΔP_{t-1}))`.

/-- **Roll's (1984) autocovariance identity.** Under the explicitly-stated hypotheses —
`q0, q1, q2` are fair random signs (`rademacher` law), `dm1, dm2` are square-integrable, and
every pair drawn from the five variables `{q0, q1, q2, dm1, dm2}` that is *split across the two
consecutive price changes* (one variable feeding `ΔP_t`, the other `ΔP_{t-1}`) is independent,
except `q1` with itself — the lag-one autocovariance of the trade-price change is `-(s/2)²`: the
own-covariance of the shared sign `q1` is the only surviving term. Independence *within* a single
price change (e.g. `dm2` with `q2`, or `dm1` with `q0`) is never used and so is not assumed: those
pairs never get multiplied together by the covariance expansion. -/
