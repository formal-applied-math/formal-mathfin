# Binomial martingale representation (completeness of the binomial market)

On the binomial tree, with the coin flips i.i.d. `Bernoulli(q)` for `0 < q < 1`
(`coinFlipMeasure q`) and Mathlib's filtration of the flips `flipFiltration` (`ℱₙ = σ(ω₀, …,
ω_{n−1})`, the pullback on `[0, T]` of `horizonFiltration T`), every `Martingale M` is the discrete
stochastic integral of a **predictable** strategy `A` against any non-degenerate martingale `S`:

  `M_N = M_0 + (A · S)_N` (`binomial_martingale_representation`),

where `(A · S)_N(ω) = ∑_{k<N} A_{k+1}(ω)·(S_{k+1}(ω) − S_k(ω))` is the library's
`martingaleTransform`, and predictable is Mathlib's `StronglyAdapted flipFiltration (A ∘ succ)`:
the holding `A_{k+1}` over `(k, k+1]` is `ℱₖ`-strongly measurable, fixed by the first `k` flips.

This is the **martingale representation theorem** in discrete time, the second pillar of the
fundamental theorem of asset pricing (completeness: every contingent claim is replicable). It is
the converse of `martingaleTransform_isMartingale` (`Foundations/MartingaleTransform.lean`): there
a predictable bounded `A` turns a martingale into a martingale; here every martingale of the tree
is such a transform of `S`. The hedge ratio is the node-wise *delta* `hedgeRatio M S n`
(`Binomial/FlipPaths.lean`), the change in `M` over the change in `S` across the two children of
a node. The conditional expectation is the node average (`oneStep_of_martingale`), so the argument
is the pathwise one-period delta hedge `repr_one_step`, telescoped.

The path space `ℕ → Bool` is the setting for the whole tree: the infinite-horizon spot and
claims of `Binomial/`, the contracts' scenarios and the Snell envelope live there, and
`flipFiltration` is the horizon filtration of the finite market pulled back along `flips T`
(`comap_flips_horizonFiltration`), where `FTAPDiscrete` needs finiteness. The representation
needs none, so it is stated once, here.

## Main results

* `binomial_martingale_representation` — every martingale of the flip filtration is its initial
  value plus the `martingaleTransform` of a predictable hedge.
* `binomialPrice_replication` — the tree price of a European claim is the initial capital of a
  hedge: the representation applied to the discounted tree value and the discounted spot.

/-- **Binomial martingale representation theorem.** Under i.i.d. `Bernoulli(q)` flips with
`0 < q < 1`, every martingale `M` of the flip filtration is its initial value plus the
`martingaleTransform` of a predictable hedge `A` against a martingale `S` whose two children at
every node differ: `M_N = M_0 + ∑_{k<N} A_{k+1}·(S_{k+1} − S_k)`. The holding `A_{k+1}` over
`(k, k+1]` is `ℱₖ`-strongly measurable, i.e. depends only on the first `k` flips; it is the
node-wise delta `hedgeRatio M S k`. The binomial market is complete: every claim is replicable by
a self-financing strategy. -/

/-- **The tree price is the cost of a hedge.** Under no-arbitrage and `S₀ ≠ 0`, for every payoff
`g` and horizon `N` there is a predictable strategy `H` (`H_{k+1}` is `ℱₖ`-strongly measurable,
it depends only on the first `k` flips) whose `martingaleTransform` against the discounted spot,
added to the tree price, is the discounted payoff on every path:

  `e^{−rN} g(S_N) = binomialPrice u d r g N S₀ + ∑_{k<N} H_{k+1} (S̃_{k+1} − S̃_k)`.

The two martingales are the discounted tree value (`martingale_discountedTreeValue`) and the
discounted spot (`martingale_discountedSpot`) under `Bernoulli(crrUpProb u d r)` flips. -/
