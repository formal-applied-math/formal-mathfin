# Purged train/test interval disjointness

López de Prado (*Advances in Financial Machine Learning*, ch. 7) purges a
training interval `[t0 i, t1 i]` from a cross-validation fold whenever it
overlaps a test interval `[t0' j, t1' j]`: it starts inside the test interval,
ends inside it, or envelops it. This file states that three-way overlap
predicate literally as given (for times in any linear order) and proves the
combinatorial payoff: any training interval surviving purging against every
test interval is genuinely disjoint from each of them, and in fact ends
strictly before it starts or starts strictly after it ends.

**Why purging works.** When each label is a measurable function of the increments
of a pre-Brownian motion over its own nonempty span (`IsSpanLabel`), a surviving training
label and any test label sit on separated spans, so the weak Markov property of
Brownian motion (`IsPreBrownianReal.indepFun_shift`: the increments after a time are
independent of the path before it) makes them independent
(`indepFun_of_purged`): no single test label carries information about a surviving
training label. The statement is pairwise; joint independence of the whole test
fold from the whole surviving training set is not proved. On the sample-weight side,
a surviving label's uniqueness (`Performance/LabelUniqueness.lean`) is the same
whether computed on the training sample alone or on the pooled sample
(`uniqueness_pooled_eq_of_purged`).

## Main results

* `overlapsTest_of_mem_of_mem`: if some point lies in both a training and a test
  interval, the overlap predicate holds between them (the interval-arithmetic
  heart of the result).
* `purged_disjoint`: a training interval `i` purging leaves untouched (no
  test interval triggers the overlap predicate against it) is disjoint from
  every test interval.
* `lt_or_lt_of_not_overlapsTest`: for nonempty spans, surviving purging means the
  two spans are strictly separated.
* `IsSpanLabel`, `IsSpanLabel.indepFun_of_le`, `indepFun_of_purged`: labels determined by
  the increments of a pre-Brownian motion over separated spans are independent; after
  purging, every test label is independent of every surviving training label.
* `uniqueness_pooled_eq_of_purged`: purging keeps test labels out of a surviving training
  label's uniqueness.
