# Relative drawdown is scale invariant

The **relative drawdown** of an equity curve `E` at time `t` is the fraction of the running
peak lost, `1 − E t / max_{s ≤ t} E s`. The running peak is Mathlib's `partialSups E`.

`MathFin.maximumDrawdown` (`Performance/DownsideMetrics.lean`) measures the largest
*absolute* decline, and is positively homogeneous: scaling the curve by `c > 0` scales it by
`c` (`maximumDrawdown_scale`). The relative drawdown is instead *invariant* under
`E ↦ c E`: a fund ten times the size, run with the same strategy, has the same relative
drawdown at every date. This is why relative drawdown, not absolute drawdown, compares
portfolios of different sizes, or denominated in different currencies at a fixed conversion
rate.

The identity holds for every `E`; the value is a drawdown fraction only where the running peak
is positive.

## Main results

* `relativeDrawdown_const_mul`: the relative drawdown of `c E` equals that of `E`.
* `maxRelativeDrawdown_const_mul`: hence so does the maximum relative drawdown up to any time.
* `partialSups_mul_relativeDrawdown_le_maximumDrawdown`: on a finite path the two notions are
  tied: the relative drawdown at `t`, scaled back up by a nonzero running peak, is the
  absolute decline `max_{s ≤ t} E s − E t`, which is at most `maximumDrawdown E`.

/-- Relative drawdown `1 − E t / max_{s ≤ t} E s` of an equity curve `E` at time `t`: the
fraction of the running peak lost by time `t`. It is a drawdown fraction only where
`partialSups E t > 0`; elsewhere the value is junk. -/

/-- **Relative drawdown, rescaled by the running peak, is bounded by the absolute maximum
drawdown**: for a nonzero running peak, `(max_{s ≤ t} E s) · relativeDrawdown E t` is the
absolute decline `max_{s ≤ t} E s − E t`, which `maximumDrawdown E` dominates. At a zero running
peak the left side is `0`, and `maximumDrawdown` is nonnegative. -/
