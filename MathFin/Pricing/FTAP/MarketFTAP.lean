# The fundamental theorem of asset pricing for a market

No arbitrage as a property of a `Market` (`Market.NoArbitrage`) and the fundamental theorem stated
about markets: no arbitrage if and only if there is a pricing measure.

A market trades at a grid of dates `t 0 ≤ t 1 ≤ ⋯ ≤ t N`. Its **no arbitrage on the grid** is the
library's `NoArbitrage` (`Pricing/FTAP/FTAP.lean`) of the deflated price sampled along the grid,
for the sampled filtration `n ↦ 𝓕 (t n)`: no bounded predictable strategy turns zero wealth into
a `P`-almost surely non-negative gain that is not almost surely zero. The market **traded on the
grid** (`Market.onGrid`) is the same deflated asset quoted in numéraire units, constant between
the dates; its pricing measures are the measures that agree on the information at the last date
with an equivalent martingale measure of the sampled price (`isPricingMeasure_toMarket_iff`).

* A pricing measure of the market up to a horizon rules out arbitrage on every grid inside the
  horizon (`Market.IsPricingMeasure.noArbitrage`), whatever the market: the continuous-time
  martingale property is sampled (`IsEMM.sampled`).
* On a finite sample space charged everywhere by `P`, the converse holds
  (`Market.noArbitrage_iff_exists_isPricingMeasure_of_finite`, Harrison–Pliska through
  `ftap_discrete`): no arbitrage on the grid exists exactly when the market traded on the grid has
  a pricing measure.
* On a general probability space the same equivalence holds **assuming
  `ConditionalOnePeriodFTAP`**, which is not proved in this library
  (`Market.noArbitrage_iff_exists_isPricingMeasure`, Dalang–Morton–Willinger through
  `DalangMortonWillinger.lean`). The unconditional statement is the frontier node `thm:dmw-ftap`.

The bare-process theorems (`ftap_discrete`, `noArbitrage_iff_exists_isEMM`) are what these are
proved from; this page is the statement about markets.

## Main definitions

* `Market.NoArbitrage`: no arbitrage for trading at the dates of a monotone grid.
* `Market.onGrid`: the market traded at the dates of a grid, in numéraire units.

## Main results

* `Market.IsPricingMeasure.noArbitrage`: a pricing measure rules out arbitrage on every grid
  inside its horizon.
* `Market.noArbitrage_iff_exists_isPricingMeasure_of_finite`: the fundamental theorem on a finite
  sample space.
* `Market.noArbitrage_iff_exists_isPricingMeasure`: the fundamental theorem, assuming the
  conditional one-period FTAP.

/-- **No arbitrage on a grid.** A one-asset market has no arbitrage when trading at the dates
`t 0 ≤ ⋯ ≤ t N` if the deflated price sampled at those dates has none for the sampled filtration:
no bounded predictable strategy turns zero initial wealth into a `P`-almost surely non-negative
gain that is not almost surely zero. -/

information at the horizon with an equivalent martingale measure of the deflated asset
(`IsPricingMeasure.exists_isEquivProbMeasure`), whose sampling along the grid is one for the
sampled price (`IsEMM.sampled`), which rules out arbitrage (`IsEMM.noArbitrage`). -/

(Harrison–Pliska): when `P` charges every state, a one-asset market has no arbitrage on the grid
exactly when the market traded on the grid has a pricing measure. This is
`noArbitrage_iff_exists_isPricingMeasure_of_finite` for the sampled deflated price. -/

dates of the grid, if `ConditionalOnePeriodFTAP` holds (a hypothesis, **not proved** in this
library: see `DalangMortonWillinger.lean`), no arbitrage on the grid is equivalent to a pricing
measure of the market traded on the grid. Only the forward direction uses the hypothesis. -/
