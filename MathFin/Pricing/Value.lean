# Pricing a contract: value, its linearity, and the martingale seam

A `Contract` is still model-agnostic data until it meets a stochastic model. `Scenario`
becomes a random variable once a model `X : ι → ℝ≥0 → Ω → ℝ` and an outcome `ω : Ω` are
fixed (`scenarioAt`); `Contract.value` integrates the resulting `pathPV` against a pricing
measure `Q` and a deflator `D : ℝ≥0 → Ω → ℝ`, each outcome's cash flows discounted along that
outcome's path `t ↦ D t ω`. A deterministic discount curve is the deflator `fun t _ ↦ D t`.

This file's connection to the market vocabulary is through `Martingale`, not `IsEMM`:
`value_deliverAsset`'s pricing identity needs a `Q`-martingale price process and `Q` a
probability measure, nothing more. The mutual-absolute-continuity content that makes a
martingale measure an *equivalent* one — `IsEMM`'s `ac`/`ac'` fields — is not needed by
anything here; it lives in `ContinuousMarket.lean` (`isEMM_noArbitrageSimple`), where it
is load-bearing.

## Main definitions

* `scenarioAt` — the scenario read off a model `X` at a single outcome `ω`.
* `Contract.value` — the pricing integral `∫ ω, c.pathPV (D · ω) (scenarioAt X ω) ∂Q` under a
  deflator `D`.
* `Contract.observation` — what a fixed-dated contract reads at an outcome: the model at its
  observations and the deflator at its payment dates; `Contract.pvOf`, its present value as a
  function of that.
* `zeroCurve` — the zero curve `t ↦ 𝔼_Q[D t]` of a deflator: the value of one unit paid at `t`.

## Main results

* `Contract.value_pay` — a single cash flow is worth the integral of its deflated payoff;
  `Contract.value_payFlows` — a schedule of them, the sum.
* `Contract.value_scale`, `Contract.value_both` — `value` is homogeneous and additive,
  inherited from `pathPV_scale` and `pathPV_both`. The two carry different hypotheses on
  purpose: `value_scale` needs none, because `integral_const_mul` holds unconditionally in
  Mathlib's Bochner integral (it returns `0` off the integrable set on both sides), while
  `value_both` genuinely needs both summands integrable — `integral_add` is false without
  them. That asymmetry, not a uniform "linearity", is the honest content of this pair.
* `Contract.value_deliverAsset` — a contract that simply delivers the asset `S` at time `T`
  is worth `∫ ω, S 0 ω ∂Q` today, given `S` is a `Q`-martingale and `Q` a probability
  measure. Mechanically this *is* conditional-expectation machinery (`condExp_ae_eq` +
  `integral_condExp`), the same kind `value_process_martingale` uses, evaluated at the
  fixed times `0` and `T` — it carries no equivalence content, so it is stated against
  `Martingale` directly rather than the library's `IsEMM` bundle, whose `ac`/`ac'` fields
  this argument never needs.
* `Contract.value_eq_of_pathPV_eq`, `value_fixedFlows_deterministic` — a contract whose deflated
  present value is the same along every outcome is worth that amount; a schedule of fixed cash
  flows on a deterministic curve is one.
* `Contract.value_congr_ae` — a fixed-dated contract has the same value in two models that agree
  almost surely at the `(underlying, date)` observations it reads (`Contract.obsList`).
* `Contract.value_eq_of_map_observation_eq` — **law invariance**: a fixed-dated contract has the
  same value in two models, on two sample spaces, whose observations and deflators at the
  contract's dates have one law (`Contract.value_eq_integral_map`).
* `Contract.value_process_martingale` — the conditional-expectation value process of a
  contract is a `Q`-martingale. Carries **no** `Integrable` hypothesis: `martingale_condExp`
  is unconditional, because Mathlib's Bochner integral returns the junk value `0` off the
  integrable set, and the constant-`0` process is trivially a martingale — so the theorem is
  honest but its content lives entirely in the integrable case. It is also stated with **no**
  `IsEMM` hypothesis: it is `martingale_condExp` specialized to a contract's cashflows, true
  for any `Q` with a `SigmaFiniteFiltration`, not a fact about the pricing measure. Shipping it
  with an `IsEMM` hypothesis would misattribute a conditional-expectation fact to the EMM
  structure — and, as `value_deliverAsset` above shows, no theorem in this file has any actual
  EMM content to misattribute it to.

## Source

The layered separation of contract semantics from pricing semantics, and the
framing "the contract is not the model", are due to Paul Bilokon,
*The Contract Is Not the Model: Proof-Carrying Exotic Derivatives and the
Economics of Model Risk* (working paper, 9 August 2026; Mathematical
Finance, Imperial College London), with code at
<https://github.com/thalesians/lean_contracts> (Apache-2.0). That paper in
turn builds on the compositional contract-DSL of
Peyton Jones, Eber and Seward (2000) and the certified-contract work of Bahr,
Berthold and Elsman (2015) and Annenkov (2018).

Bilokon separates pricing semantics from contract semantics — a pricing model
is a law over deterministic scenarios — and that separation is his; but his
`PricingModel.value` integrates a function never shown measurable and his
`value_eq_of_pathPV_eq` is `congrArg` under the integral, whereas this file's
linearity carries real integrability hypotheses and its delivery-of-asset
identity is a genuine martingale-pricing fact (`Martingale.condExp_ae_eq`
chained through `integral_condExp`), not an unconditional integral congruence.

No code is copied from `lean_contracts`; every definition and proof here is
written for this library. See `docs/specs/2026-08-16-contracts-tower-design.md`
§6 for the full credit line.
