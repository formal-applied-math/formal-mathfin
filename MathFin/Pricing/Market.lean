# The market and its pricing functional

**A market** is a filtered measurable space with a reference measure `P`, the adapted prices
`S i t` of the traded assets and a strictly positive adapted numéraire `N t`. **A pricing
measure** up to a horizon `T` is a probability measure with the null events of `P` among the
events known at `T` (equivalent to `P` on `𝓕 T`) under which every deflated price `S i t / N t`,
frozen at `T`, is a martingale.

Equivalence is asked on `𝓕 T` only, as in Föllmer–Schied (§5.2) and Delbaen–Schachermayer: a
horizon-`T` market cannot tell measures apart beyond `𝓕 T`, and on an infinite path space the
risk-neutral and the physical laws are typically singular (i.i.d. coin flips with two
up-probabilities, Brownian motions with two drifts) while equivalent on every `𝓕 T`. For a finite
`P` nothing is lost: a pricing measure agrees on `𝓕 T` with one equivalent to `P` everywhere
(`IsPricingMeasure.exists_isEquivProbMeasure`), and a measure equivalent everywhere is one on `𝓕 T`
(`IsPricingMeasure.of_isEquivProbMeasure`). **The price** of a contract under a
measure `Q` is its value (`Contract.value`) with the deflator `N 0 / N t` on the market's assets:

  `price Q c = 𝔼_Q[∑ (N 0 / N tₖ) · cₖ]` over the contract's cash flows `cₖ` at `tₖ`.

This is the trunk the library's pricing devices hang on (docs/specs/2026-11-07-one-trunk-design.md,
§3 I1). It is a price when `Q` is a pricing measure and the deflated cash flows are integrable: the
definition is total, and the theorems that call it a price carry those conditions (docs/design.md
§2).

Two facts make it the price rather than one more integral:

* a traded asset is priced at its price: under a pricing measure, with a deterministic `N 0`, the
  claim that delivers asset `i` at a date `t ≤ T` is worth `𝔼_Q[S i 0]`
  (`IsPricingMeasure.price_pay_obs`);
* a fixed-dated contract's price depends on the market only through the law of what it reads: two
  markets, on two sample spaces, whose assets and deflators at the contract's observations and
  payment dates have one law under their measures give the same price
  (`price_eq_of_map_observation_eq`).
  A parametric price of a fixed-dated contract defined in one concrete model is therefore its
  price in every market with that law.

The price at an intermediate date `t` is the conditional expectation of the deflated cash flows
given `𝓕 t`, re-expressed at `t` (`priceAt`); deflated to `0`, it averages to the price
(`integral_deflator_mul_priceAt`, the tower property). The zero-coupon bond price `P(t, T)` of the
rates models is the price at `t` of one unit paid at `T`
(`Contracts.bondPrice_deflator_eq_priceAt`, in `Models/Rates/Caplet.lean`).

Changing the numéraire changes the pricing measure and not the price: the market with numéraire `N`
in place of `B` prices a payment at `T` under the numéraire measure `Q^N` exactly as the original
market does under `Q` (`price_pay_withNumeraire`, the change-of-numéraire theorem
`changeOfNumeraire` read through the price).

On a finite sample space the price of a single payment is `statePricePricing` with the state
prices `q ω = (N 0 / N t)(ω) · Q {ω}` (`price_pay_eq_statePricePricing`), non-negative for every
`Q` (`statePrice_nonneg`).

## Main definitions

* `Market`: a filtered measurable space, its reference measure, the traded assets and a numéraire.
* `Market.deflator`: `N 0 / N t`. `Market.deflated`: `S i t / N t`.
* `Market.IsPricingMeasure`: a probability measure equivalent to `P` on `𝓕 T` making every
  deflated asset a martingale up to the horizon `T`.
* `Market.price`: the value of a contract under a measure, deflated by the numéraire.
* `Market.priceAt`: the price at an intermediate date, a random variable.
* `Market.withNumeraire`: the same market with another numéraire.

## Main results

* `Market.IsPricingMeasure.of_isEquivProbMeasure`: a measure equivalent to `P` everywhere that
  makes the deflated assets frozen martingales is a pricing measure.
* `Market.IsPricingMeasure.of_trim_eq`: a measure that agrees with a pricing measure on `𝓕 T` is
  one.
* `Market.IsPricingMeasure.exists_isEquivProbMeasure`: a pricing measure agrees on `𝓕 T` with a
  pricing measure equivalent to `P` everywhere.
* `Market.IsPricingMeasure.price_pay_obs`: a traded asset is priced at its initial price.
* `Market.price_eq_of_map_observation_eq`: law invariance of the price.
* `Market.integral_deflator_mul_priceAt`: the deflated price at `t` averages to the price.
* `Market.price_pay_withNumeraire`: the price is invariant under the change of numéraire.
* `Market.price_pay_eq_statePricePricing`: on a finite sample space the price of a payment is
  state-price pricing, with non-negative state prices (`Market.statePrice_nonneg`).
