# The one-date market

The smallest market with a pricing measure, and the one a closed-form family reads in when it
prices at a single date: one traded asset that is quoted at its initial price `s₀` (growing at the
rate `r` of the money market, so that the deflated price is the constant `s₀`) until a date `τ`,
and at a random value `X` from `τ` on, with the money market `e^{rt}` as numéraire and no
information before `τ` (`Market.oneDate`).

Up to the horizon `τ`, the deflated asset is a martingale for a measure `Q` exactly when it is a
probability measure for which `X` is integrable with `𝔼_Q[X] = s₀ e^{rτ}`. With `Q` equivalent to
the reference measure `P`, it is a pricing measure (`Market.isPricingMeasure_oneDate`). The
information is the time change of the two-step filtration `⊥ ≤ mΩ` along the date `τ`
(`Market.dateFiltration`), so the martingale is that of `martingale_min_of_condExp_succ`, read
along the time change (`Martingale.comp`).

The price of a contract that reads the asset at `τ` only is the integral against `Q` of its payoff,
discounted by `e^{−rτ}` (`Market.price_pay_obs_oneDate`, `Market.price_europeanCall_oneDate`).

The model is as small as can be: the initial price is a parameter, with no dynamics before `τ`,
so that a measure prices the market says only that it is equivalent to `P` and calibrated to the
quote `s₀`. A family's socket here certifies that its law prices a market, and the work is in the
family's own moment identity (the Esscher or Merton compensator, the tilted mean).
The families that instantiate it (`Models/Jumps/Market.lean`, `Insurance/EsscherPremium.lean`) say
which law of `X` and which `Q` they read in it.

## Main definitions

* `Market.oneDate`: the market of a terminal value `X`, an initial price `s₀`, a rate `r` and a
  date `τ`.
* `Market.dateFiltration`: the information of the market, nothing before `τ` and everything from
  `τ` on.

## Main results

* `Market.isPricingMeasure_oneDate`: a probability measure equivalent to `P`, with `X` integrable
  and `𝔼_Q[X] = s₀ e^{rτ}`, is a pricing measure up to `τ`.
* `Market.integral_eq_of_isPricingMeasure_oneDate`: the converse for `τ > 0`: a pricing measure
  makes `X` integrable with mean `s₀ e^{rτ}`.
* `Market.price_pay_obs_oneDate`: the claim paying the asset at `τ` is worth `𝔼_Q[e^{−rτ} X]`.
* `Market.price_europeanCall_oneDate`: the call struck at `K` is worth `𝔼_Q[e^{−rτ} (X − K)⁺]`.
