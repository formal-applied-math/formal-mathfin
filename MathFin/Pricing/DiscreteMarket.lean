# The discrete-time market on the trunk

A model for the instruments of `Contracts/Instruments/Options.lean`, its fundamental theorems of
asset pricing read on the trunk's `Market`, and the seam between the contracts layer and the
multi-period FTAP. A one-asset discrete-time market on a general filtered probability space, a price
`S : ℕ → Ω → ℝ` with an equivalent martingale measure `IsEMM 𝓕 P S T Q`, is a contract model
map: between integer dates the underlying is constant, `discreteAssets S T () t = S ⌊t⌋₊` frozen
at the horizon `T` (the price is a `Q`-martingale only up to `T`). The price `S` is quoted in
units of the numeraire, so cash is not discounted, `D ≡ 1`.

The filtration of the model is `floorFiltration 𝓕`, `t ↦ 𝓕 ⌊t⌋₊`, the time change of `𝓕` along
the step count `t ↦ ⌊t⌋₊` (`Filtration.comp`), and the frozen price is a martingale for it
(`Martingale.comp`). The risk-neutral lemmas of `Pricing/Parity.lean` then
apply as they stand: the forward is worth `S₀ − K` and call minus put is `S₀ − K` at every
maturity (`value_forward`, `value_europeanCall_sub_put`); at an integer maturity `n` the
underlying is `S (min n T)` (`discreteAssets_natCast`). Parity is not re-proved here.

The discrete market is a `Market` (`toMarket`): the frozen price, the floor filtration and the
unit numéraire. An equivalent martingale measure is a pricing measure of it
(`isPricingMeasure_toMarket_of_isEMM`), and a pricing measure, which is equivalent to `P` only on
the information at the horizon, agrees there with an equivalent martingale measure
(`isPricingMeasure_toMarket_iff`, the converse direction through `Martingale.of_comp` and
`Market.IsPricingMeasure.exists_isEquivProbMeasure`). Its price is the contract value with `D ≡ 1`
(`price_toMarket`).

**The fundamental theorem on the trunk.** A pricing measure rules out arbitrage
(`Market.IsPricingMeasure.noArbitrage_toMarket`). On a finite sample space with full support, no
arbitrage is equivalent to the existence of a pricing measure
(`noArbitrage_iff_exists_isPricingMeasure_of_finite`, Harrison–Pliska through `ftap_discrete`); on
a general space the same holds with no assumption (`noArbitrage_iff_exists_isPricingMeasure`,
Dalang–Morton–Willinger for one asset, `OneAsset.noArbitrage_iff_exists_isEMM`). The composite
`exists_isPricingMeasure_parity` adds parity: an arbitrage-free adapted one-asset market has one
pricing measure `Q` under which, for every strike and maturity, the forward's price is `S₀ − K` and
the call's price less the put's is `S₀ − K`.

## Main definitions

* `floorFiltration`: the continuous-time filtration `t ↦ 𝓕 ⌊t⌋₊` of a discrete one, the time
  change `𝓕.comp Nat.floor_mono`.
* `discreteAssets`: the discrete market as a contract model map, frozen at the horizon.
* `toMarket`: the discrete market as a `Market`, with the unit numéraire.

## Main results

* `value_forward`, `value_europeanCall_sub_put`: forward value and put–call parity under an `IsEMM`.
* `isPricingMeasure_toMarket_iff`: the pricing measures of `toMarket` are the measures that agree
  with an `IsEMM` on the information at the horizon.
* `noArbitrage_iff_exists_isPricingMeasure_of_finite`: the finite-`Ω` FTAP on the trunk.
* `noArbitrage_iff_exists_isPricingMeasure`: the FTAP on the trunk, on a general probability space.
* `exists_isPricingMeasure_parity`: no arbitrage gives a pricing measure under which parity holds.
