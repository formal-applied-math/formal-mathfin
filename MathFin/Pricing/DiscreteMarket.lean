# The contracts priced in a discrete-time market with an equivalent martingale measure

The third model for the instruments of `Contracts/Instruments/Options.lean`, after the
Black–Scholes and binomial ones, and the seam between the contracts layer and the multi-period
FTAP. A one-asset discrete-time market on a general filtered probability space, a price
`S : ℕ → Ω → ℝ` with an equivalent martingale measure `IsEMM 𝓕 P S T Q`, is a contract model
map: between integer dates the underlying is constant, `discreteAssets S T () t = S ⌊t⌋₊` frozen
at the horizon `T` (the price is a `Q`-martingale only up to `T`). The price `S` is quoted in
units of the numeraire, so cash is not discounted, `D ≡ 1`.

The filtration of the model is `floorFiltration 𝓕`, `t ↦ 𝓕 ⌊t⌋₊`, the time change of `𝓕` along
the step count `t ↦ ⌊t⌋₊` (`Filtration.comp`), and the frozen price is a martingale for it
(`Martingale.comp`). The risk-neutral lemmas of `Pricing/Parity.lean` then
apply as they stand: the forward is worth `S₀ − K` and call minus put is `S₀ − K` at every
maturity (`value_forward`, `value_europeanCall_sub_put`); at an integer maturity `n` the
underlying is `S (min n T)` (`discreteAssets_natCast`). Parity is not re-proved here.

The discrete market is a `Market` (`toMarket`): the frozen price, the floor filtration and the
unit numéraire. Its pricing measures at the horizon are exactly its equivalent martingale measures
(`isPricingMeasure_toMarket_iff`, the converse direction through `Martingale.of_comp`), and its
price is the contract value with `D ≡ 1` (`price_toMarket`).

The composite `exists_isPricingMeasure_parity` closes the loop with the Dalang–Morton–Willinger
reduction: **assuming `ConditionalOnePeriodFTAP`** (the conditional one-period FTAP, not proved in
this library), an arbitrage-free adapted integrable market has one pricing measure `Q` under which,
for every strike and maturity, the forward's price is `S₀ − K` and the call's price less the put's
is `S₀ − K`.

## Main definitions

* `floorFiltration`: the continuous-time filtration `t ↦ 𝓕 ⌊t⌋₊` of a discrete one, the time
  change `𝓕.comp Nat.floor_mono`.
* `discreteAssets`: the discrete market as a contract model map, frozen at the horizon.
* `toMarket`: the discrete market as a `Market`, with the unit numéraire.

## Main results

* `value_forward`, `value_europeanCall_sub_put`: forward value and put–call parity under an `IsEMM`.
* `isPricingMeasure_toMarket_iff`: the pricing measures of `toMarket` are the `IsEMM`s.
* `exists_isPricingMeasure_parity`: no arbitrage gives a pricing measure under which parity holds,
  given `ConditionalOnePeriodFTAP`.
