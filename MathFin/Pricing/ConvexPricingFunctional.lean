# Convexity passes through the pricing functional

**If the payoffs `g i K` are convex in a parameter `K` in every state, and the state prices `q i`
are non-negative, then the price `K ↦ statePricePricing s q (g · K)` is convex in `K`.** Pricing
with non-negative state prices is a positive linear functional, and a positive linear functional
preserves convexity.

That is why call prices are convex in the strike and why a butterfly spread costs nothing
negative: the call payoff is convex in the strike (`convexOn_call_payoff`,
`Contracts/Instruments/CallPayoff.lean`), and the pricing functional carries the convexity from
payoff to price. Neither fact about prices is separate from this one.

The same principle under an arbitrary law is `convexOn_integral_call`
(`Models/BlackScholes/StrikeConvexity.lean`), Mathlib's `integral_convexOn_of_integrand_ae`
applied to the call payoff, of which the finite-state statements here are the finitely supported
case; its infinitesimal face is `∂²_K bsV ≥ 0` (`bsV_partial_KK_nonneg`) and the non-negativity of
the implied density (`Models/ModelFree/BreedenLitzenberger.lean`).

## Main results

* `statePricePricing_convexOn`: pricing with non-negative state prices preserves convexity in any
  parameter.
* `callPrice_finiteState_convexOn_K`: in a finite-state market the call price is convex in the
  strike.
* `callPrice_finiteState_butterfly_nonneg`: a butterfly spread has non-negative price, the
  price-level face of `butterfly_payoff_nonneg` (`Models/ModelFree/Spreads.lean`).

/-- **The pricing functional preserves convexity.** With non-negative state prices `q i` on `s`,
if each state's payoff `g i K` is convex in `K`, so is the price `statePricePricing s q (g · K)`:
each state's convexity inequality, multiplied by `q i ≥ 0`, sums to the price's. -/

/-- **The call price is convex in the strike (finite-state market).** With non-negative state
prices and terminal values `S i`, the price `K ↦ statePricePricing s q (max (S · − K) 0)` of the

(`statePricePricing_convexOn`). -/
