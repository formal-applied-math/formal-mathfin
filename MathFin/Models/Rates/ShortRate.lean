# Stochastic discounting, and contracts in the Gaussian short-rate models

In a short-rate model the discount factor is a random variable at each time,
`D t = exp(−∫₀ᵗ r_s ds)` (`shortRateDiscount`), and `Contract.value Q D X c` values a contract
along each outcome by that outcome's discount path.

A schedule of fixed cash flows sees only the model's zero curve `P(0, t) = 𝔼_Q[D t]`
(`zeroCurve`, `Pricing/Value.lean`): its value under the stochastic discount factor is its value
on that curve (`value_fixedFlows_eq_zeroCurve`), given each `D tᵢ` integrable. The Gaussian
short-rate models give the curve in closed form, and the integrability comes with it, since a
function whose integral is nonzero is integrable (`value_fixedFlows_of_zeroCurve_eq`). So a
coupon bond is worth `∑ cᵢ P(0, tᵢ)` with

* Vasicek: `P(0, t) = A(t) e^{−B(t) r₀}` (`value_fixedFlows_vasicek`, from
  `vasicekBondPrice_affine`);
* Hull–White with continuous forcing `θ`: the same `B`, and `A` carrying `θ`
  (`value_fixedFlows_hullWhite`, from `HullWhite.bondPrice_affine`);
* two-piece GSR, for payment dates after the volatility switch `T*`:
  `P(0, t) = exp(−M(t) + V(t)/2)` with the GSR variance (`value_fixedFlows_gsr`, from
  `gsrBondPrice_eq`).

In each, the measure is read as the pricing measure: no change of measure is built, as in the
bond-price theorems the instances consume. Contracts whose cash flows depend on the rate, such as
a floating leg paying the rate it observes, are not covered by these closed forms: valuing one
needs the bond prices `P(t, T)` at `t > 0`, the conditional expectation `bondPrice`
(`Models/Rates/Caplet.lean`). For the Vasicek, Hull–White and two-piece GSR models they are in
closed form (`bondPrice_vasicek`, `bondPrice_hullWhite`, `bondPrice_gsr`,
`Models/Rates/VasicekBond.lean`, `Models/Rates/HullWhiteBond.lean`,
`Models/Rates/GSRBond.lean`), and the bond put and caplet follow
(`Models/Rates/Jamshidian.lean`).

## Main definitions

* `shortRateDiscount` — `D t = exp(−R t)` from an integrated short rate `R`.

## Main results

* `value_fixedFlows_vasicek`, `value_fixedFlows_hullWhite`, `value_fixedFlows_gsr`.

## Source

The layered separation of contract semantics from pricing semantics, and the
framing "the contract is not the model", are due to Paul Bilokon,
*The Contract Is Not the Model: Proof-Carrying Exotic Derivatives and the
Economics of Model Risk* (working paper, 9 August 2026; Mathematical
Finance, Imperial College London), with code at
<https://github.com/thalesians/lean_contracts> (Apache-2.0). That paper in
turn builds on the compositional contract-DSL of
Peyton Jones, Eber and Seward (2000) and the certified-contract work of Bahr,
Berthold and Elsman (2015) and Annenkov (2018).

No code is copied from `lean_contracts`; every definition and proof here is
written for this library. See `docs/specs/2026-08-16-contracts-tower-design.md`
§6 for the full credit line.
