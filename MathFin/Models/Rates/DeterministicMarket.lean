# The deterministic-rates bond market

The simplest term-structure model as a `Market`: a deterministic bank account `N`
(`N t = e^{rt}` for a flat rate) as numéraire, and zero-coupon bonds `P(t, τᵢ) = N t / N τᵢ` as
the traded assets (`deterministicMarket`). After its maturity a bond is worth what its proceeds
earn in the bank account, so the formula holds at every date and the bond is a self-financing
position. Nothing is random, so every probability measure is a pricing measure
(`isPricingMeasure_deterministicMarket`): the deflated bond `P(t, τᵢ) / N t = 1 / N τᵢ` is
constant.

In any market with a deterministic numéraire a schedule of fixed cash flows is worth its flows
discounted by `N 0 / N` (`price_fixedFlows_deterministicMarket`), and the price of a unit payment
at `τᵢ` is the bond's price (`price_pay_deterministicMarket`). The first-order immunization and
the key-rate durations of `Models/Rates/` differentiate such a flat-rate value, and the value
of a zero-coupon portfolio is the price of its schedule when the numéraire is `e^{rt}`, and the
price of a coupon bond at an annually compounded yield `y` is the price of its schedule when the
numéraire is `(1 + y)^⌊t⌋` (`bondPortfolioValue_eq_price`).

The stochastic short-rate models (`Models/Rates/ShortRate.lean`) price the same schedules through
their zero curve; that their bonds are martingales after deflation by the bank account is not
proved here.

## Main definitions

* `MathFin.Rates.deterministicMarket`: the market of a deterministic numéraire with zero-coupon
  bonds of given maturities.

## Main results

* `MathFin.Rates.isPricingMeasure_deterministicMarket`: every probability measure prices the
  deterministic bond market, at every horizon.
* `MathFin.Rates.price_pay_deterministicMarket`: the price of a unit payment at `τᵢ` is the
  bond's market price `N 0 / N τᵢ`.
* `MathFin.Rates.price_fixedFlows_deterministicMarket`: a schedule of fixed cash flows is worth
  its flows discounted by the numéraire.
* `MathFin.Rates.bondPortfolioValue_eq_price_exp`, `bondPriceDisc_eq_price`: the flat-rate value of
  a zero-coupon portfolio (numéraire `e^{rt}`) and the annually compounded price of a coupon bond
  (numéraire `(1 + y)^⌊t⌋`) are market prices.
* `MathFin.Rates.bondPortfolioValue_eq_price`: the two in one conjunction.
