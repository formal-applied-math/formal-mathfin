# The binomial tree as a market

The binomial model of `Models/Binomial/Binomial.lean` as a `Market` (`Binomial.market`): coin-flip
paths `ω : ℕ → Bool` under a physical law `P`, the information of the flips made by `t`
(`flipFiltration` along the step count `t ↦ ⌊t / h⌋₊`, `Filtration.comp`), the spot after those
flips as the traded asset, and the money market `e^{ρ n}` after `n` steps as numéraire.

* **The risk-neutral law prices it.** Under no-arbitrage, i.i.d. flips that go up with the
  probability `crrUpProb u d ρ` are a pricing measure of the market at every horizon, for a
  physical law of i.i.d. flips going up with any probability `0 < p < 1`
  (`isPricingMeasure_coinFlipMeasure`): the deflated spot is the discounted spot after the steps
  made (`deflated_market`), a martingale for the flip filtration (`martingale_discountedSpot`) and
  so along the step count (`Martingale.comp`), and the two laws are equivalent on the flips made by
  the horizon (`coinFlipMeasure_trim_equiv`), though not on the whole path space when `p ≠ q`.
* **Its price is the binomial value.** On contracts paying at whole numbers of steps the
  deflator `e^{−ρ ⌊t/h⌋}` is the binomial discount `e^{−ρ t/h}`, so the market's price is the
  `Contract.value` of `Binomial.lean` (`price_market`), and a European payoff is priced at its
  backward-induction tree price (`price_market_pay_eq_binomialPrice`).
* **The pricing measure is unique.** At a horizon of `N` steps every pricing measure agrees with
  the risk-neutral law on the first `N` flips (`trim_eq_of_isPricingMeasure`): it maps to an
  equivalent martingale measure of the `N`-period tree (`isEMM_horizonSpot_map`), which is unique
  (`IsEMM.eq_horizonMeasure`). So every pricing measure gives a European payoff its tree price
  (`price_pay_eq_binomialPrice_of_isPricingMeasure`).
* **The fundamental theorem.** For `S₀ > 0`, `0 < d < u` and at least one step, the market has a
  pricing measure exactly when `d < e^ρ < u` (`exists_isPricingMeasure_iff`): a pricing measure
  rules out the one-period arbitrage of `binomialNoArb_of_noArbitrage`.

## Main definitions

* `Binomial.market`: the binomial tree with step `h` as a `Market`.

## Main results

* `Binomial.isPricingMeasure_coinFlipMeasure`: the risk-neutral law of the flips is a pricing
  measure, for every physical law of i.i.d. flips.
* `Binomial.price_market`: on grid dates the market's price is the binomial value.
* `Binomial.price_market_pay_eq_binomialPrice`: the price of a European payoff is its tree price.
* `Binomial.trim_eq_of_isPricingMeasure`: every pricing measure is the risk-neutral law on the flips
  made by the horizon.
* `Binomial.price_pay_eq_binomialPrice_of_isPricingMeasure`: every pricing measure gives the tree
  price.
* `Binomial.exists_isPricingMeasure_iff`: a pricing measure exists iff `d < e^ρ < u`.
