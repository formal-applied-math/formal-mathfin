# A pricing measure gives a normalised call price function

Call prices in the strike are the static face of the fundamental theorem. In a market with unit
numéraire and a positive asset, a pricing measure `Q` up to `T` makes the asset a `Q`-martingale,
so its forward `F` is its mean, and the calls at the strikes `k F`, priced in units of `F`, are the
call prices `k ↦ 𝔼[(X − k)⁺]` of the positive mean-one variable `X = S_T / F`. Those are a
normalised call price function (`IsNormalizedCallPrice`): this is the forward direction of Roper's
Theorem 2.1. The converse, a market from a call price function, is not proved here.

## Main results

* `isNormalizedCallPrice_integral_call`: for a positive integrable `X` of mean one under a
  probability measure, `k ↦ 𝔼[(X − k)⁺]` is a normalised call price function.
* `Market.IsPricingMeasure.isNormalizedCallPrice`: the same for the calls of a market with unit
  numéraire and a positive asset under a pricing measure, in units of the forward.

/-- **The call prices of a positive mean-one variable are a normalised call price function.**
Convexity is that of the payoff carried through the integral (`convexOn_integral_call`); the
intrinsic bound is `𝔼[(X − K)⁺] ≥ 𝔼[X − K] = 1 − K`; the upper bound is `(X − K)⁺ ≤ X`; and the
price vanishes at large strikes by dominated convergence. -/
